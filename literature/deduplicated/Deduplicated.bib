However, this enormous number of new devices have also brings in an increasing energy consumption in standby for awaiting wire-less communication or status change. To reduce standby energy, existing approaches use real-time consumption data and machine learning techniques to identify standby energy, but aggregate data or intermediate model training updates in the cloud to collaboratively perform load forecasting, which could directly or indirectly cause personal data leakage, alongside with significant communication bandwidth and extra cloud service monetary cost. On the other hand, such a global collaborative model yields unsatisfactory en-ergy management performance as they fail to capture the diversity of each residence. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved, communication-efficient, personalized and cloud-service-free resi-dential energy management system (EMS) with personalized feder-ated deep reinforcement learning (PFDRL) framework to tackle the standby energy reduction in residential building.},

	abstract = {Driven by the tremendous increase in rooftop solar panels and battery installations in Australian states, several studies have been conducted to efficiently manage battery operations with the imported grid power through battery energy storage systems (BESS). Therefore, it is crucial for the BESS to carefully decide the power set-points of the installed batteries to maintain user comfort while operating household appliances. Additionally, BESS should be capable of reducing the electricity bills by optimally managing the battery operation to sustain times of higher tariff prices for the imported grid power. This paper formulates the scheduled operation of the BESS as a Markov decision Process (MDP) that enables the BESS to Figure out numerous scenarios and decides the optimal power set-points for both batteries and grid power. A model-free reinforcement learning approach is proposed to manage the batteries’ power-sharing and grid operation set-points to solve this MDP problem. This approach utilizes the advantages of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to decide the shared power set-points every 5 minutes interval for the day ahead operation of the BESS. Finally, the proposed model is trained and validated using historical data of the Australian National Electricity market to offer an optimal scheduled control pattern for the daily BESS operations.},

Firstly, interval mathematics is used to model the multiple uncertainties in the system. Secondly, considering the system's carbon emissions and carbon transaction costs, optimize the system operation with the goal of the lowest comprehensive operating cost and the best user comfort. To solve the problem of interval multi-objective optimization, deep reinforcement learning (DQN) and interval multi-objective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) are proposed for “offline training” and “online guidance”. The low-carbon optimization scheduling problem of intelligent buildings under multiple uncertain factors is efficiently solved. The results of an example show that the proposed IMOPSO based on DQN can consider the system's low carbon, economical and user comfort, which effectively improves the system's ability to deal with multiple uncertain factors.},

It enables us to manage IoT devices 24/7 from anywhere. However, it also brings several cyber security risks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. A large-scale DDoS attack immediately overwhelms the victim’s network or system with a massive volume of unwanted traffic from the pool of compromised IoT devices. As a result, it prevents legitimate users from accessing the victim’s services or applications. Further, protecting Internet-based applications and networks from large-scale IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks is a challenging task. In the literature, several techniques are available to protect networks and services from IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks. However, the occurrence and sophistication of IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks are expanding every year.

	abstract = {In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.},

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has become more attractive to provide electricity to rural and remote areas, which increases the reliability and sustainability of the electrical system, particularly for areas where electricity extension is difficult. Despite this, the integration of hybrid RESs is accompanied by many problems as a result of the intermittent and unstable nature of RESs. The extant literature has discussed the integration of RESs, but it is not comprehensive enough to clarify all the factors that affect the integration of RESs. In this paper, a comprehensive review is made of the integration of RESs. This review includes various combinations of integrated systems, integration schemes, integration requirements, microgrid communication challenges, as well as artificial intelligence used in the integration. In addition, the review comprehensively presents the potential challenges arising from integrating renewable resources with the grid and the control strategies used. The classifications developed in this review facilitate the integration improvement process. This paper also discusses the various optimization techniques used to reduce the total cost of integrated energy sources. In addition, it examines the use of up-to-date methods to improve the performance of the electrical grid. A case study is conducted to analyze the impact of using artificial intelligence when integrating RESs. The results of the case study prove that the use of artificial intelligence helps to improve the accuracy of operation to provide effective and accurate prediction control of the integrated system. Various optimization techniques are combined with ANN to select the best hybrid model. PSO has the fast convergence rate for reaching to the minimum errors as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) percentage reaches 1.10\% in 3367.50 s.},

	abstract = {Robust reliability Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) turns out to be a crucial step for an efficient energy management system in a modern power grid, especially under renewable energy employment. The integration of all such components in a GEP model makes it a large-scale, nonlinear, and mixed-variable mathematical modeling problem. In this paper, the presence of wind energy uncertainty is analyzed. Both long and short-term uncertainties are incorporated into the proposed GEP model. The first step concerns the impact of long-term wind uncertainties through the annual variations of the capacity credit of two real sites in Egypt at Zafaranh and Shark El-ouinate. The second step deals with the short-term uncertainties of each wind site. The wind speed uncertainty of each wind site is modeled by probability distribution function. Then, wind power is estimated from the wind power curve for each wind site and Monte-Carlo Simulation is performed. Fast Gas Turbine and/or Pump Hydro Storage are incorporated to cope with short-term uncertainties. Sensitivity analysis is implemented for 3, 6, and 12 stages as short and long planning horizons to minimize the total costs with wind energy penetration and emission reduction over planning horizons. Also, a novel Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) with model modifications such as Virtual Mapping Procedure, Penalty Factor Approach, and the Modified of Intelligent Initial Population Generation is utilized for solving the proposed GEP problem. The obtained results are compared with other algorithms to ensure the superior performance of the proposed HBA. According to the results of the applicable test systems, the proposed HBA performs better than the others, with percentage reductions over CSA, AO, BES, and PSO ranging up to 4.2, 2.72, 2.7, and 3.4\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the challenge of accurate load forecasting in cluster microgrids, where distributed energy systems interlink to operate seamlessly. As renewable energy sources become more widespread, ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply in the face of variable weather conditions is a significant challenge for power providers. The variability in energy consumption patterns, influenced by human behavior and environmental conditions, further complicates load prediction. The inherent instability of solar and wind energies adds complexity to forecasting load demand accurately. This paper suggests a solution in addressing some challenges by proposing a Modified Temporal Convolutional Feed Forward Network (MTCFN) for load forecasting in cluster microgrids. The Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm is employed to determine optimal configurations, addressing the intricacies of this complex optimization problem. Data collected from the Microgrid Market Share and Forecast 2024–2032 report, the efficiency of the proposed approach is evaluated through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and R-squared. The RMSE, MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-squared values of the MTCFN are 0.4\%, 1.5\%, 0.6\%, 6.8\%, and 0.8\%, respectively. The optimization algorithm's effectiveness is cross-validated through rigorous testing, training, and validation processes, revealing that the FFNN model based on the Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm yields superior load forecasting results. This research contributes to the advancement of signal, image, and video processing in the context of resilient and accurate energy management in cluster microgrids.},

Q-learning algorithms first determine the origin subsidies, and the proposed self-financing mechanism then balances the expected costs and gains, and generates the final subsidies. During market equilibrium, energy storage is fully charged when there is excess electricity and discharged when there is insufficient electricity. The electricity market then calculates the cash flow of the subsidies, and the remaining cash is used to make up for the self-discharge loss of the storage units. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TripleS in maintaining grid stability.},

	abstract = {The deployment of renewable energy sources will boost the decarbonization of the power sector that will help in mitigating the ill effects of climatic pollution. But the integration of renewable energy resources for hybrid power generation poses two technical challenges: (a) uncertainty and (b) variability due to renewable energy (RE) characteristics that make forecasting of generated power availability arduous. New technological advances to improve design and operation is the need of the hour. Demand response (DR) can be the answer as it provides flexibility to operate automatically as well as manual interference. DR programs support active consumer participation. Yet, carrying real-time decisions out of large-scale data is a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based demand response has recently emerged as enabling technologies to address this issue. This paper carries an extensive summary developed out of review carried out from research articles published in this domain from the year 2019 up to the year 2020. The focus is on recent advances in four methods of AI: machine learning, nature-inspired algorithm, artificial neural network, and multi-agent system used in the demand response program to integrate renewable energy.},

	abstract = {Climate change has become a major problem for humanity in the last two decades. One of the reasons that caused it, is our daily energy waste. People consume electricity in order to use home/work appliances and devices and also reach certain levels of comfort while working or being at home. However, even though the environmental impact of this behavior is not immediately observed, it leads to increased CO2 emissions coming from energy generation from power plants. It has been shown that about 40\% of these emissions come from the electricity consumption and also that about 20\% of this percentage could have been saved if we started using energy more efficiently. Confronting such a problem efficiently will affect both the environment and our society. Monitoring energy consumption in real-time, changing energy wastage behavior of occupants and using automations with incorporated energy savings scenarios, are ways to decrease global energy footprint. In this review, we study intelligent systems for energy management in residential, commercial and educational buildings, classifying them in two major categories depending on whether they provide direct or indirect control. The article also discusses what the strengths and weaknesses are, which optimization techniques do they use and finally, provide insights about how these systems can be improved in the future.},

	abstract = {Short-term residential load forecasting is of great significance to smart grid applications. Deep learning techniques, especially recurrent neural networks, can greatly improve the performance of prediction models. However, deep neural networks usually have low interpretability, which creates obstacles for customers to deeply understand the prediction results and make quick responses. In addition, the existing deep learning prediction methods rely heavily on the centralized training of massive data. However, the transmission of data from the client to the server poses a threat to the data security of customers. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework with federated learning for short-term residential load forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new automatic relevance determination network for feature interpretation, combined with the encoder–decoder architecture to achieve interpretable multi-step load prediction. In the edge computing network, the training scheme based on federated learning does not share the original data, which can effectively protect data privacy. The introduction of iterative federated clustering algorithm can alleviate the problem of non-independent and identical distribution of data in different households. We use two real-world datasets to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss in detail the feature interpretation of these two datasets.},

	abstract = {The implementation of renewable energy sources reduces dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, but it comes at a significant cost to the grid due to the need for coupling multiple energy sources. This necessitates the optimization of energy production using artificial intelligence techniques that can reflect the characteristics of distributed energy management from the storage capacity of the microgrid while considering the consumer load. As such, this study develops an energy management algorithm based on the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) utility function to model the operator’s risk-aversion or risk-seeking behavior, generating optimal exchange strategies in a dynamic environment. The reinforcement learning-based agent provides an understanding of energy storage capacity constraints in aggregate load/discharge energy decision making in the microgrid, using a discrete action space that depends on a reward related to the value of the optimal online objective function of the microgrid. By analyzing microgrid management under different system state definitions, the results show that substantially improved performance can be achieved compared to a traditional model that assumes deterministic information. The findings provide solid experimental validation of the potential of deep reward-based learning techniques to enable more efficient, flexible, and cost-effective energy management, particularly with the integration of more intermittent renewable energy sources.},

If predictive information about the stochastic elements is available offline, recent works have shown that it is possible to rely on an (expensive) parameter tuning phase to improve the behavior of a simple online solver so that it roughly matches the solution quality of an anticipative approach but maintains its original efficiency. Here, we start from a state-of-the-art offline/online optimization method that relies on optimality conditions to inject knowledge of a (convex) online approach into an offline solver used for parameter tuning. We then propose to replace the offline step with (Deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, which results in a simpler integration scheme with a higher potential for generalization. We introduce two hybrid methods that combine both learning and optimization: the first optimizes all the parameters at once, whereas the second exploits the sequential nature of the online problem via the Markov Decision Process framework. In a case study in energy management, we show the effectiveness of our hybrid approaches, w.r.t. the state-of-the-art and pure RL methods. The combination proves capable of faster convergence and naturally handles constraint satisfaction.},

In the first step, we exploit the advantages of the Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep learning model to predict the next daily electricity price based on time series. In the second step, we use a type-2 fuzzy logic controller to decide which energy source will exploit the excess energy produced or meet the MG need. Real data is used in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMS whose superiority is proved through the test period. The BiLSTM forecasting model better performs compared to other related algorithms designed to the electricity price prediction. In addition, the proposed decision-making process can reduce the total MG cost and protect the batteries against the deep discharge and maximum charge in order to prolong their lifespan.

As a consequence to this, the dependence of electricity supply and demand has parallelly seen a dramatic increase on covariates like solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature. Addressing the demand response scenario with efficient forecasting strategies is critical for the smart grid stability. With increment of renewable energy factor in total share of electricity generation, it becomes imperative to consider the external factors covariates while predicting the electricity price and load forecasting. Forecasting strategies, based on statistical and machine learning models, facilitates efficient and informed responses for electricity market. However, due to presence of large pool of forecasting models each having its own suitability, it becomes cumbersome to choose an appropriate sophisticated model selection from them. This work presents a methodological review of existing forecasting statistical and machine learning models and algorithms, with the prime purpose of choosing a best suited model for a specific environment or scenario. Data used for this purpose are a time series data, and information is very scattered in nature; thus, the process to make a full dataset and combining it with external covariates is a complex phenomenon. The work also discusses the process of making the multivariate time series dataset based on U.S. Energy Information Administration and combined it with typical meteorological year (TMY3) datasets. To validate the outcome of literature survey, detail experiment has been performed using the prepared dataset, and comparative analysis is presented.},

The framework is tested on a novel multi-energy residential microgrid model that encompasses electrical, heating and cooling storage as well as thermal production systems and renewable energy generation. One of the main challenges faced when dealing with real-time optimal control of such multi-energy systems is the need to take multiple continuous actions simultaneously. The proposed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent has shown to handle well the continuous state and action spaces and learned to simultaneously take multiple actions on the production and storage systems that allow to jointly optimize the electrical, heating and cooling usages within the smart grid. This allows the approach to be applied for the real-time optimal energy management of larger scale multi-energy Smart Grids like eco-distrits and smart cities where multiple continuous actions need to be taken simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Due to the fact that electric vehicles have not broadly entered the vehicle market there are many attempts to convince producers to integrate technologies that utilise embedded batteries for purposes different from driving. The vehicle-to-grid technology, for instance, literally turns electric vehicles into a mobile battery, enabling new areas of applications (e.g., to provide regulatory energy, to do grid-load balancing, or to buffer surpluses of energy) and business perspectives. Utilising a vehicle’s battery, however is not without a price—in this case: the driver’s mobility. Given this dependency, it is interesting that most available works consider the application of electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation, that is, detached from mobility-related issues. The distributed artificial intelligence laboratory, or DAI-Lab, is a third-party funded research lab at Technische Universität Berlin and integrates the chair for agent technologies in business applications and telecommunication. The DAI-Lab has engaged in a large number of both, past and upcoming projects concerned with two aspects of managing electric vehicles, namely: energy and mobility. This article aims to summarise experiences that were collected during the last years and to present developed solutions which consider energy and mobility-related problems jointly.},

	abstract = {With the popularity and affordability of ZigBee wireless sensor technology, IoT-based smart controlling system for home appliances becomes prevalent for smart home applications. From the data analytics point of view, one important objective from analyzing such IoT data is to gain insights from the energy consumption patterns, thereby trying to fine-tune the energy efficiency of the appliance usage. The data analytics usually functions at the back-end crunching over a large archive of big data accumulated over time for learning the overall pattern from the sensor data feeds. The other objective of the analytics, which may often be more crucial, is to predict and identify whether an abnormal consumption event is about to happen. For example, a sudden draw of energy that leads to hot spot in the power grid in a city, or black-out at home. This dynamic prediction is usually done at the operational level, with moving data stream, by data stream mining methods . In this paper, an improved version of very fast decision tree (VFDT) is proposed, which learns from misclassified results for the sake of filtering the noisy data from learning and maintaining sharp classification accuracy of the induced prediction model. Specifically, a new technique called misclassified recall (MR), which is a pre-processing step for self-rectifying misclassified instances, is formulated. In energy data prediction, most misclassified instances are due to data transmission errors or faulty devices. The former case happens intermittently, and the errors from the latter cause may persist for a long time. By caching up the data at the MR pre-processor, the one-pass online model learning can be effectively shielded in case of intermitting problems at the wireless sensor network; likewise the stored data could be investigated afterwards should the problem persist for long. Simulation experiments over a dataset about predicting exceptional appliances energy use in a low energy building are conducted. The reported results validate the efficacy of the new methodology VFDT + MR, in comparison to a collection of popular data stream mining algorithms from the literature.},

Pricing is accordingly used to reflect energy availability, to allocate such a limited resource to those loads that value it most. However, the strictly competitive mechanism can result in service interruption in presence of competing demand. To solve this issue we investigate on the use of forward contracts, i.e., service-level agreements priced to reflect the expectation of future supply and demand curves. Given the limited resources of microgrids, service availability is an opposite objective to the one of system reactivity. We firstly design policy-based brokers and identify then a learning broker based on artificial neural networks. We show the latter being progressively minimizing the reimbursement costs and maximizing the overall profit.},

	abstract = {In smart environments, there is an increasing demand for scalable and autonomous management systems. In this regard, energy efficiency hands out challenging aspects, for both home and business usages. Scalability in energy management systems is particularly difficult in those industry sector where power consumption of branches located in remote areas need to be monitored. Being autonomous requires that behavioural rules are automatically extracted from consumption data and applied to the system. Best practices for the specific energy configuration should be devised to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Best practices should also be revised and applied without human intervention against topology changes. In this paper, the Internet of Things paradigm and machine learning techniques are exploited to (1) define a novel system architecture for centralised energy efficiency in distributed sub-networks of electric appliances, (2) extract behavioural rules, identify best practices and detect device types. A system architecture tailored for autonomous energy efficiency has interesting applications in smart industry—where energy managers may effortlessly monitor and optimally setup a large number of sparse divisions—and smart home—where impaired people may avoid energy waste through an autonomous system that can be employed by the users as a delegate for decision making.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of new technologies such as smart grid and increasing the use of renewable energy in the grid, energy prediction has become more important in the electricity industry. Furthermore, with growing the integration of power generated from renewable energy sources into grids, an accurate forecasting tool for the reduction in undesirable effects of this scenario is essential. This study has developed a novel approach based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) for forecasting day-ahead solar power. The aim is to find a pattern of solar power changes at a given time in consecutive days. The proposed approach consists of two steps. In the first step, the cosine similarity is used to determine the similarity of solar power variations on consecutive days to a particular vector. In the second step, the obtained information from the first step is fed to HMM as a feature vector. These data are used for training and forecasting day-ahead solar power. After obtaining the preliminary results of the prediction, two known filters are utilized as post-processing to remove spikes and smooth the results. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested on real NREL data. No meteorological data (even solar radiation) are used; moreover, the model is fed only from the solar power of the past 23 days. To evaluate the proposed method, a feed-forward neural network and a simple HMM are examined with the same data and conditions. All three methods are tested with and without the post-processing. The results show that the proposed model is superior to other examined methods in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

One of the most well-known and efficient learning methods is neural networks. This paper focuses on the different neural networks developed to build learning models able to adapt to concept drifts on streaming data.

Their limits to address the challenges related to the problem of the improvement of electrical grid flexibility in presence of distributed Wind–PV renewable energy resources within the context of energy transition will be highlighted.

The aim of this paper is to assess the tuning efficiency of multi-attention recurrent neural network for multi-step forecasting of battery state-of-charge under provision of primary frequency control. In particular, this paper describes hyper-parameter optimization of the network with a tree-structured parzen estimator and compares such optimization performance with random and manual search on a simulated battery state-of-charge dataset.

With scattered renewable energy resources and loads, multi-agent systems are a viable tool for controlling and improving the operation of microgrids. They are autonomous systems, where agents interact together to optimize decisions and reach system objectives. This paper presents an overview of multi-agent systems for microgrid control and management. It discusses design elements and performance issues, whereby various performance indicators and optimization algorithms are summarized and compared in terms of convergence time and performance in achieving system objectives. It is found that Particle Swarm Optimization has a good convergence time, so it is combined with other algorithms to address optimization issues in microgrids. Further, information diffusion and consensus algorithms are explored, and according to the literature, many variants of average-consensus algorithm are used to asynchronously reach an equilibrium. Finally, multi-agent system for multi-microgrid service restoration is discussed.

Electricity load is a factor which plays a major role in forecasting. For this purpose, we proposed a model which is based on selection, extraction and classification of historical data. Grey Correlation based Random Forest (RF) and Mutual Information (MI) is performed for feature selection, Kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is used for feature extraction and enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for classification. Our proposed scheme is then compared with other benchmark schemes. Simulation results proved the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model for hourly load forecasting of one day, one week and one month.},

They have the potential to achieve higher energy savings and dynamic performances compared to singlespeed, single -motor BEVs. However, a more complex and robust energy management system (EMS) is needed to achieve these benefits. Hence, this work reviews the design process and real-time implementation of EMSs tailored for DM-BEVs, starting from the fundamental concepts of two -motor coupling. The advantages and disadvantages of the most popular dual -motor architectures and their influence on the EMS design complexity are presented, followed by a revision of the reported energy management controllers. Besides the most prominent methods, classified as rule -based or optimization -based techniques, reinforcement learningbased EMSs are discussed in detail, given their near -optimal, real-time implementation and adaptability to newer, unforeseen drive cycles. Finally, the standard procedures and equipment required to assess the EMS' performance with hardware -in -the -loop tests are presented. Conclusions and open challenges for the energy management controllers of DM-BEVs are discussed at the end of this work.},

In the proposed algorithm, function approximation technology is introduced to handle the continuous massive bidding scales and avoid the dimension curse.

	abstract = {Reducing energy costs is an emerging aspect in the research on the economic and environmental dimen-sions of manufacturing systems. The share of electricity cost accounts for approximately 60 \% of the total energy cost of a manufacturing system, whereas the share of oil, coal, and gas accounts for the remaining 40 \%. The electricity cost is dependent on the electricity price and usage. In terms of the electricity price, one of the pricing strategies widely used in the USA and Europe is called real-time pricing (RTP), which is characterised by hourly price changes. Compared to other pricing strategies, RTP yields the highest reward and the highest risk. In the RTP strategy, the electricity price is influenced by the supply and demand of the energy market. Hence, the energy cost of manufacturing cannot be determined by the manufacturing companies, implying a high level of risk. However, if manufacturing companies seize the opportunity to perform more manufacturing tasks when the energy price is low, the cost-savings will be significant, im-plying a high level of reward. In this study, we propose an integrated energy management system (IEMS) to reduce the energy cost of manufacturing systems. The IEMS consists of an energy storage equipment and an intelligent switch mechanism. When the electricity price is high, the manufacturing system is powered by the energy storage equipment. When the electricity price is low, the manufacturing system is powered by the public electricity grid, and the energy storage equipment is charged. The decision-making of these operations is performed by the intelligent switch mechanism based on double deep Q-learning. To validate this framework, a case study is conducted, in which an IEMS is developed to reduce the electricity cost of a scale-model factory. Based on an online test of the IEMS in different manufacturing cycles, it is concluded that the proposed IEMS approach achieves a cost reduction of approximately 57.21 \%.(c) 2022 The Authors.

The MG comprises of wind and photovoltaic resources, diesel generator, electrical energy storage, and combined heat and power generations to serve electrical and thermal loads at the lower-level of energy management system (EMS). All distributed energy resources (DERs) and customers are modelled as self-interested agents who adopt reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviours and operation costs. Based on this algorithm, agents have the capability to interact with each other in a distributed manner and find the best strategy in competitive environment. At the upper-level of EMS, there is an energy management agent that gathers the information of agents of lower-level and clears the MG electrical and thermal energy market in line with predetermined goals. Utilizing energy availability from different DERs and variety of customers' consumption patterns, considering uncertainty of renewable generation and load consumption and taking into account technical constraint of DERs are the strengths of the presented framework. Performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated under different conditions of agents learning and using epsilon-greedy, soft-max and upper confidence bound methods.

	abstract = {Wind energy has been increasingly adopted to mitigate climate change. However, the variability of wind energy causes wind curtailment, resulting in considerable economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind curtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly weaken the economic potential of BESS in energy trading. Ideal BESS scheduling should balance onsite wind curtailment reduction and market bidding, but practical implementation is challenging due to coordination complexity and the stochastic nature of energy prices and wind generation. We investigate the joint-market bidding strategy of a co-located wind-battery system in the spot and Regulation Frequency Control Ancillary Service markets. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based approach that decouples the system’s market participation into two related Markov decision processes for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind curtailment while performing joint-market bidding to maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we validated the coordinated bidding strategy, with outcomes surpassing the optimization-based benchmark in terms of higher revenue by approximately 25\% and more wind curtailment reduction by 2.3 times. Our results show that joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance of wind-battery systems compared to participating in each market separately. Simulations also show that using curtailed wind generation as a power source for charging the BESS can lead to additional financial gains. The successful implementation of our algorithm would encourage co-location of generation and storage assets to unlock wider system benefits.},

However, FCSs may result in the power system overload. Therefore, the deployment of the battery energy storage system (BESS) in FCSs is considered as a potential solution to avoid system overload. However, the optimal operation of FCSs equipped with BESS is challenging due to the involvement of several uncertainties, such as EV arrival/departure times and electricity prices. Therefore, in this study, a deep reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to operate FCSs with BESS under these uncertainties. The stateof-the-art soft actor-critic method (SAC) is adopted and the model is trained with one-year data to cover seasonality and different types of days (working days and holidays). The performance of SAC is compared with two other deep reinforcement learning methods, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient. A comprehensive reward function is devised to train the model offline, which can then be used for the real-time operation of FCS with BESS under different uncertainties. The trained model has successfully reduced the peak load of the FCS during both weekdays and holidays by optimizing the operation of the BESS. In addition, the robustness of the proposed model against different EV arrival scenarios and extreme market price scenarios is also evaluated. Simulation results have shown that the proposed model can reduce the peak load of the FCS under diverse conditions in the desired fashion.},

In search of the most effective ways to interact within themselves and with the external energy system, local energy communities become platforms for exciting experiments in the field of new energy practices including local markets for flexibility, building cooperative micro grids, achieving energy autonomy, and many others. This work aims to present a unified approach to building and optimally managing the community microgrids with an internal market, given the social, environmental, and economic benefits of a particular location of such a community. A new modeling framework is introduced, based on bilevel programming and reinforcement learning, for structuring and solving the internal local market of a community microgrids, composed of entities that may exchange energy and services among themselves. The overall framework is formulated in the form of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while the upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator (Community EMS). We strengthen the traditional bilevel problem statement by the local energy management system (Local EMS) introduction based on Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. Our approach makes it possible to enable interaction of the local control systems for microgrids with the community microgrid operator as part bilevel programming problem solution.

This paper proposes a continuous real-time cooperative multi-agent system (MAS) for H-MG. Real-time MAS interacts with H-MG agents to perform as independent learners applying a distributed and cooperative reinforcement learning method, while state variables are shared to coordinate their real-time behavior. Therefore, the fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) method is investigated to control the agents in the continuous state space and achieve an efficient solution. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy to guarantee the energy supply and reduce the electricity market price. The results of the simulation demonstrate that using the proposed cooperative MAS with the real-time FQL method in the energy management of the H-MG will reduce the electricity market price by 10\%, increase the health of the storage system by 35.67\%, and enhance the utilization of the PV system to charge PEV for 8\% at the peak load demand.},

	abstract = {Effective bidding on multiple electricity products under uncertainty would allow a more profitable market participation for hybrid power plants with variable energy resources and storage systems, therefore aiding the decarbonization process. This study deals with the effective bidding of a photovoltaic plant with an energy storage system (PV-ESS) participating in multi-timescale electricity markets by providing energy and ancillary services (AS) products. The energy management system (EMS) aims to maximize the plant's profits by efficiently bidding in the day-ahead and real-time markets while considering the awarded products' adequate delivery. EMS's bidding decisions are usually obtained from traditional mathematical optimization frameworks. However, since the addressed problem is a multi-stage stochastic program, it is often intractable and suffers the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for efficient multi-timescale bidding. Two agents based on multi-view artificial neural networks with recurrent layers (MVANNs) are adjusted to map environment observations to actions. Such mappings use as inputs available information related to electricity market products, bidding decisions, solar generation, stored energy, and time representations to bid in both electricity markets. Sustained by a price-taker assumption, the physically and financially constrained EMS's environment is simulated by employing historical data. A shared cumulative reward function with a finite time horizon is used to adjust both MVANNs' weights simultaneously during the learning phase. We compare the proposed MADRL framework against scenario-based two-stage robust and stochastic optimization methods. Results are provided for one-year-round market participation of the hybrid plant at a 1-minute resolution. The proposed method achieved statistically significant higher profits, less variable incomes from both electricity markets, and better provision of awarded products by achieving smaller and less variable energy imbalances through time.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-agent day-ahead microgrid energy management framework. The objective is to minimize energy loss and operation cost of agents, including conventional distributed generators, wind turbines, photovoltaics, demands, battery storage systems, and microgrids aggregator agent. To forecast market prices, wind generation, solar generation, and load demand, a deep learning-based approach is designed based on a combination of convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent unit. Each agent utilizes the designed learning approach and its own historical data to forecast its required parameters/data for scheduling purposes. To preserve the information privacy of agents, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to find the optimal operating point of microgrid distributedly. To enhance the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm, an accelerated ADMM is presented based on the concept of over-relaxation. In the proposed framework, the agents do not need to share with other parties either their historical data for forecasting purposes or commercially sensitive information for scheduling purposes. The proposed framework is tested on a realistic test system. The forecast values obtained by the proposed forecasting method are compared with several other methods and the accelerated distributed algorithm is compared with the standard ADMM and analytical target cascading.

	abstract = {Given the steep rises in renewable energy's proportion in the global energy mix expected over several decades, a systematic way to plan the long-term deployment is needed. The main challenges are how to handle the sig-nificant uncertainties in technologies and market dynamics over a large time horizon. The problem is further complicated by the fast-timescale volatility of renewable energy sources, potentially causing grid instability and unfulfilled demands. As a remedy, energy storage and power-to-hydrogen systems are considered in conjunction with energy management system but doing so raises the complexity of the planning problem further. In this work, the long-term capacity planning for a hybrid microgrid (HM) system is formulated as a multi-period stochastic decision problem that considers uncertainties occurring at multiple timescales. Long-term capacity decisions are inherently linked with energy dispatch and storage decisions occurring at fast-timescale and it is best to solve for them simultaneously. However, the computational demand for solving it becomes quickly intractable with problem size. To this end, we propose to develop a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of the problem and use simulation-based reinforcement learning for multi-period capacity investments of the planning horizon. The MDP includes the policies used for dispatch and storage operation, which are represented by linear programming as a part of the simulation model. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated with a case study, where decisions over multiple decades are considered along with various un-certainties of multi-timescales. Economic and environmental assessments are performed, providing valuable guidelines for government's energy policy.},

Using this platform, two different types of energy storage market models are proposed to promote local-level (within the microgrid) and communal- or global-level ESSs' participation in the intra- and intermicrogrid TE markets. Also, a reinforcement learning algorithm known as simulated-annealing-based Q-learning is used to develop bidding strategies for ESSs to participate in the TE markets. Besides energy trading, the proposed system also accounts for the losses caused by energy transactions between ESSs and microgrids using a complex current-tracing-based loss allocation method. The overall efficacy of the proposed energy market management system is demonstrated using a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system with multiple microgrids and ESSs. Based on simulation results, it is observed that the proposed model can effectively reinforce the balance between the supply and the demand in the microgrids using the mix of local and global ESSs.},

These decisions are made with the aim of maximizing the profit achieved by the REP under the assumption that mixed types of customers with different behaviors in the electricity market are considered. While some of the customers have installed smart meters with an embedded home energy management system (HEMS) in their home, others do not participate in the demand response (DR) programs. For this purpose, a bi-level hybrid demand modeling framework is proposed. It firstly uses an optimal energy management algorithm with bill minimization in order to model the behavior of customers with smart meters. Then, using a customers? behavior learning machine (CBLM), the behavior of other groups without smart meters is modeled. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model cannot only schedule usage of home appliances to the interests of customers with smart meters but can also be used to understand electricity usage behavior of customers without smart meters. The proposed model includes a stacked auto-encoder (SAE), one of the deep learning (DL) methods suitable for real-valued inputs, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the established hybrid demand model for all customers, a profit maximization algorithm is developed in order to achieve optimal prices for the REP under relevant market constraints. The results of the case studies confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Due to electricity market deregulation over the past two decades, the responsibility for new generation is with private investors who seek profit maximisation. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which are one solution to combat the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, also require private investment for widespread deployment. This paper develops a methodology for applying Real Options Analysis to a BESS project from the perspective of private investors to determine the optimal investment time and BESS capacity size (MWh). Two models with different timescales are utilized: the operational model which is hourly, and the planning model which is yearly. The operational model is solved using a reinforcement learning algorithm called Deterministic Policy Gradient, while the planning model is solved using a MATLAB inbuilt nonlinear global optimiser called patternsearch. The methodology is demonstrated for a 100 MW BESS connected to the Irish grid and trading exclusively in the day-ahead market. Three different BESS CAPEX future realisations are analysed along with three different BESS manufacturers' degradation warranties for C-Rates under 0.37C. The results show that BESS CAPEX has minimal influence on investment timing but has a significant effect on BESS size. Furthermore, extrapolating degradation warranty for C-Rates greater than 0.37C does not influence optimal investment timing or sizing, while a change in BESS energy retention limit at year 10 can have a significant influence on the viability of a BESS project.},

The energy cost in form of electricity bills usually consists of energy charge and demand charge, and the demand charge based on peak power may account for a large proportion of the energy cost given a significant fluctuating power curve. In this work, we investigate the backup battery characteristics and electricity charge tariffs at ECs and explore the corresponding cost-saving potential. Specifically, we transform the backup battery group into distributed battery energy storage system (BESS) and strategically schedule the BESS to minimize the energy cost of service providers. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach to BESS charging/discharging in coping with the dynamic power demand and BESS state at each EC. To enable better decision-making and speed up agent training, we further design the customized invalid action masking (IAM) method and apply the prioritized experience replay (PER) scheme. The experiment results based on real-world EC power traces show that the proposed approach can reduce the demand charge and overall electricity bill by up to 27\% and 13\%, respectively.},

For the primary frequency control (PFC), which is one of the highest-value applications of BESS, this uncertainty is linked to the changes of BESS state-of-charge (SOC) under stochastic frequency variations. In order to quantify this uncertainty, this paper aims to exploit one of the recent achievements in the field of deep learning, i.e. multi-attention recurrent neural network (MARNN), for BESS SOC forecasting under PFC. Furthermore, we extend the MARNN model for probabilistic forecasting with a hybrid approach combining Mixture Density Networks and Monte Carlo dropout that incorporate the uncertainties of the data noise and the model parameters in the form of prediction interval (PI). The performance of the model is studied on BESS SOC datasets that are simulated based on real frequency measurements from three European synchronous areas in Great Britain, Continental Europe, and Northern Europe and validated by three PI evaluation indexes. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantile regression algorithms, the proposed hybrid model performed well with respect to the coverage probability of PIs for the different regulatory environments of the PFC.},

	abstract = {The future of energy flexibility in microgrids (MGs) is steering towards a highly granular control of the end-user customers. This calls for more highly accurate uncertainty forecasting and optimal management of risk and flexibility options. This paper presents a novel data-driven model to optimize the operation of MGs based on a risk-averse flexi-intelligent energy management system (RFEMS), considering the rising challenge of global climate change. It considers the presence of renewables, a diesel generator, and flexibility resources (FRs) containing a demand response program (DRP), distributed electric vehicles (EVs), and electric springs (ESs). In the first phase, the proposed model, by means of a novel hybrid deep-learning (DL) model, forecasts uncertain parameters associated with wind and solar generations, load demand, and day-ahead energy market price. The architecture of the proposed hybrid forecasting model is composed of several stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and a cascade neural network. In the second phase, the MG operator (MGO), based on the obtained uncertainty forecasting results, in the context of a hybrid risk-controlling model, optimizes the MG operation using the provided demand-side flexibility. The proposed optimization problem is linearized stochastic pro-gramming with robust concepts, subject to AC optimal power flow constraints, MG flexibility restrictions, and operating limits of local resources. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed RFEMS by using real German datasets on a 33-bus test MG is analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed forecasting model over several hybrid DL models. In particular, the root mean square error (RMSE) index for wind, solar, load, and price forecasting is improved by 53.35\%, 73.24\%, 80.24\%, and 58.1\%, respectively. Further analysis of the proposed RFEMS reveals that operating indices in two 33-bus and 69-bus test networks are significantly improved. It paves pathways to risk-averse, flexible, and economic operation of smart active dis-tribution networks.},

The primary objectives include minimizing the distribution system operator (DSO) cost and optimizing the exchanged power between DSO and NMG, and the power transmission losses and the secondary include minimizing MG’s operating cost, optimal use of renewable energy resources (RER) and energy storage systems (ESS), minimizing the exchanged power cost with the main grid and, risk analysis.

Demand response can promote enhancing demand flexibility and energy efficiency while reducing consumer costs. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based approach with an agent assigned to individual buildings to facilitate demand response programs with diverse loads, including space heating/cooling and electrical equipment. Achieving real-time autonomous demand response in networks of buildings is challenging due to uncertain system parameters, the dynamic market price, and complex coupled operational constraints. To develop a scalable approach for automated demand response in networks of interconnected buildings, coordination between buildings is necessary to ensure demand flexibility and the grid's stability. We propose a MADRL technique that utilizes an actor-critic algorithm incorporating shared attention mechanism to enable effective and scalable real-time coordinated demand response in grid-responsive buildings. The presented case studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to obtain decentralized cooperative policies for electricity costs minimization and efficient load shaping without knowledge of building energy systems. The viability of the proposed control approach is also demonstrated by a reduction of over 6\% net load demand compared to standard reinforcement learning approaches, deep deterministic policy gradient, and soft actor-critic algorithm, as well as a tailored MADRL approach for demand response.},

This article thoroughly examines the progress, difficulties, and potential breakthroughs in the integration of AI technology with smart grids to enhance the use of hydrogen energy . The study focuses on utilising AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning to optimise the processes of generating, distributing, and utilising energy. The discoveries stemming from this investigation facilitate prognostic maintenance, instantaneous decision-making, and effective demand-side management, augmenting the durability and eco-friendliness of energy systems. Nevertheless, this auspicious panorama is surrounded by significant obstacles. Significant issues develop regarding data privacy and security when sensitive information is sent over AI-powered grid systems. Interoperability difficulties necessitate standardising the communication protocols to enable smooth data flow. Additionally, further research is essential to tackle the technological limitations of AI in grid management. This article presents a forward-thinking viewpoint on the incorporation of AI-enhanced smart grid technologies, with a focus on future expectations. Autonomous energy management systems offer improved flexibility, proactive maintenance, and flexible energy distribution. Simultaneously, the combination of Edge AI and decentralisation facilitates the establishment of energy generating and storage facilities at local levels. This helps to make immediate decisions, minimises delays, and improves the durability of the power grid. The report emphasises the pivotal importance of governmental and regulatory factors in directing these advancements. The foundation for a safe and flexible power system is established by data privacy legislation, grid modernisation initiatives, and incentives for hydrogen energy. The essay promotes energy market reforms, technological neutrality, and measures that improve grid resilience as a means of achieving environmental sustainability. The integration of hydrogen energy into smart infrastructure is facilitated by AI, and strategic planning and collaborative design are crucial for achieving a resilient, sustainable, and efficient energy future.

This study focuses on the integration of PEVs in H-MGs using an EMS and analyzes its impact on electrical power grids (EPGs). We examine the effect of PEV charging and discharging patterns on H-MG energy flow, considering various scenarios such as high renewable energy generation, different levels of PEV penetration, and EPG connection status. Our findings indicate that an efficient EMS can significantly enhance H-MGs’ overall efficiency by intelligently scheduling PEV charging and discharging, maximizing the use of locally generated renewable energy, and reducing peak load on the EPG. We demonstrate that a cooperative multi-agent system EMS, driven by a robust continuous and real-time fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) method, can reduce electricity market prices by 15\% by increasing the use of renewable energy generation by 25\%. To fully realize the benefits of EMS, we address challenges such as reducing dependence on EPG by 30\%, improving battery state by 12\%, and ensuring EPG stability in the face of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) based approach to facilitate efficient load shaping through automated demand response in a microgrid. Achieving real-time autonomous demand response with energy management systems in buildings can be challenging due to factors like uncertain system parameters, the dynamic market price, and the complex coupled operational constraints. To develop a scalable approach for automated demand response in a microgrid, it is necessary to allow for coordination between buildings in the grid to smoothen the overall demand curve. We present a MA-DRL agent that utilizes an actor-critic algorithm incorporating a shared attention mechanism to enable an effective and scalable real-time cooperation to prevent the non-coordinated peak shifting actions in the complicated building system. A computational case study conducted with nine residential buildings revealed the attention-based MA-DRL agent’s ability to execute decentralized cooperative policies without knowledge of building systems models or electricity price dynamics. Viability of the proposed control approach was also demonstrated by a reduction in net electricity consumption of over 6\% accompanied by reduction in carbon emissions as compared to both conventional and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches for automated demand response.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have gained increasing popularity in several fields thanks to their ability to find hidden and complex relationships between data. Their capabilities for solving complex optimization tasks have made them extremely attractive also for the design of the Energy Management System (EMS) of electrified vehicles. Among the plethora of existing techniques, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have unprecedented potential since they can self-learn by directly interacting with the external environment through a trial-and-error procedure. In this paper, a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent, which exploits Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to map the state-action pair to its value, was trained to reduce the CO2 emissions of a state-of-the-art diesel Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) available on the European market. The proposed methodology was tested on a virtual test rig of the investigated vehicle while operating on a charge-sustaining logic. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the reward to test the capabilities of different penalty functions to improve the fuel economy while guaranteeing the battery charge sustainability. The potential of the proposed control strategy was firstly assessed on the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) and benchmarked against a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimization to evaluate each reward. Then the best agent was tested on a wide range of type-approval and Read Driving Emission (RDE) scenarios. The results show that the best-performing agent can reach performance close to the DP reference, with a limited gap (7 \%) in terms of CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {The implementation of energy storage system (ESS) technology with an appropriate control system can enhance the resilience and economic performance of power systems. However, none of the storage options available today can perform at their best in every situation. As a matter of fact, an isolated storage solution's energy and power density, lifespan, cost, and response time are its primary performance constraints. Batteries are the essential energy storage component used in electric mobility, industries, and household applications nowadays. In general, the battery energy storage systems (BESS) currently available on the market are based on a homogeneous type of electrochemical battery. However, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on a mixture of various types of electrochemical batteries can potentially provide a better option for high-performance electric cars, heavy-duty electric vehicles, industries, and residential purposes. A hybrid energy storage system combines two or more electrochemical energy storage systems to provide a more reliable and efficient energy storage solution. At the same time, the integration of multiple energy storage systems in an HESS requires advanced control strategies to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the system. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the control systems used in HESSs for a wide range of applications. An overview of the various control strategies used in HESSs is offered, including traditional control methods such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and advanced control methods such as model predictive control (MPC), droop control (DC), sliding mode control (SMC), rule-based control (RBC), fuzzy logic control (FLC), and artificial neural network (ANN) control are discussed. The paper also highlights the recent developments in HESS control systems, including the use of machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and genetic algorithms (GA). The paper provides not only a description and classification of various control approaches but also a comparison between control strategies from the evaluation of performance point of view. The review concludes by summarizing the key findings and future research directions for HESS control systems, which is directly linked to the research on machine learning and the mix of different control type strategies.},

In this paper, a BESS is used to provide energy arbitrage (EA) and frequency regulation (FR) services simultaneously to maximize its total revenue within the physical constraints. The EA and FR actions are taken at different timescales. The multitimescale problem is formulated as two nested Markov decision process (MDP) submodels. The problem is a complex decision-making problem with enormous high-dimensional data and uncertainty (e.g., the price of the electricity). Therefore, a novel co-optimization scheme is proposed to handle the multitimescale problem, and also coordinate EA and FR services. A triplet deep deterministic policy gradient with exploration noise decay (TDD-ND) approach is used to obtain the optimal policy at each timescale. Simulations are conducted with real-time electricity prices and regulation signals data from the American PJM regulation market. The simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better than other studied policies in literature.},

This study targets the rather typical case of a general household with solar panels. All four classes of loads are considered, while many existing studies only investigate a restricted subset. Considering the high stochasticity in real-time pricing and solar power generation, we propose an online approach in a hybrid semidecentralized framework, where each shiftable load is controlled by a deep neural network (DNN), and all adjustable loads are coordinated together by fast online optimization. We train each DNN via efficient and effective imitation learning (IL) instead of popular reinforcement learning (RL). This framework allows adjustable loads to react properly to possibly poor actions of shiftable loads via online one-step optimization to alleviate their adverse impact. Numerical experiments with real-world data show that, compared with RL, our approach can reduce the training time significantly, while its execution time is only slightly affected. Moreover, our approach outperforms the traditional day-ahead optimization method and the fully decentralized multiagent RL and multiagent IL methods by a wide margin, attaining an average cost fairly close to the theoretical minimum.},

During a certain period in a day, the power demand peaks, making it difficult for the grid to meet the demand. To deal with this problem, an intelligent Home Energy Management (HEM) can be beneficial. Smart HEM systems can schedule loads from peak to low peak hours. Thereby reducing peak load on the grid as well as reducing decreasing the costs incurred by a user. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Reinforcement Learning model with prioritized experience sampling (PQDN-DR) for appropriate demand response, and the problem of load shifting is simulated as a game. We also propose a novel reward system for better convergence of the DRL model to near-optimal strategies and a DR adapted Epsilon Greedy Policy to guide the agent in exploration phase for faster convergence. The proposed system minimizes power demand peak and consumers? bills simultaneously. The proposed method has successfully reduced the peak load and peak costs in smaller DR environment. The agent reduced costs and overall variance of the load profile for all customers for 24 h in the standard DR environment.},

To narrow the gap between ideal V2G goals and actual applications needs, energy trading system has to overcome the challenges of over-centralized structure, inflexible timeline adaptation, limited market scale and energy efficiency, excessive feedback time costs, and low rate of economic return. To address these issues and ensure a secure energy market, we propose a decentralized intelligent V2G system called V2G Forecasting and Trading Network (V2GFTN) to achieve efficient and robust energy trading in campus EV networks. A multiple blockchain structure is proposed in V2GFTN to ensure trading security and data privacy between energy requests and offers. V2GFTN also integrates energy forecasting functions for EVs with a smart energy trading and EV allocation mechanism called SRET so that the EVs with driving tasks can supply their extra power back to the grid and achieve higher energy efficiency and economic profit. Through rigorous experimentation and compared with equivalent studies, V2GFTN system has demonstrated higher economic profit and energy demand fill rate by up to 1.6 times and 1.9 times than the state-of-the-art V2G approaches.},

The EV operates as an energy producer and consumer to help home energy management system (HEMS) flexibly regulate the power balance. To facilitate trading between homes and reduce the total cost of the system, we introduce a double auction (DA) market among homes, which can also protect their privacy. We formulate this problem as a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a DA-based multi-agent proximal policy optimization (DA-MAPPO) algorithm, which solves the problem of sequential decisions and dimensional disasters. The simulations show that the model proposed can reduce the total system cost by 14.8\% compared with the model without DA market. The proposed algorithm can improve the motivation of homes to participate in the DA market and protect their privacy compared with other algorithms.},

It can increase the system's reliability and thus reduce the cost of energy generation. However, the RES demonstrate inadequate load following and are not transportable.

This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures.},

To realize social welfare maximization with privacy preserving in a dynamic energy market, this article propose a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for quotation decision optimization in continuous double auction (CDA)-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market. To address the nonstationarity and privacy violation brought by multiagent context, we utilize mean-field approximation to abstract the unauthorized local information of other agents from the public market dynamics. An abstract Q-value function is developed for each agent to infer the neighbor agents' local observation and action through the public clearing results in the dynamic CDA market. Moreover, to avoid sparse reward so as to stabilize the learning process, we propose a dynamic potential-based reward shaping term in the reward. Without altering the learnt optimal policies, the agents can be informed with the additional energy storage state as the reward shaping in each time instants. To validate the effectiveness and economy of our proposed method, simulation studies are conducted on a real-world dataset. Simulation results show that the proposed MARL method produces up to 17\% more convergent episodic reward and 67\% less energy bills which indicates competitive convergence performance and significant economic benefits.},

The Grid connected MG that contains wind turbine, fuel cell (FC), diesel generator and electric vehicle (EV) to supply its demands, is modeled as a multi-agent system (MAS). The DER and customer are considered as self-interested agents that try to maximize their profits and optimize their behavior. These agents use RL to interact with each other in distributed manner without any direct communication. The market operator of MG is responsible to gather agents' data that have been submitted and clears the market to meet the desired goals.

BESS often seeks various revenue streams by taking part in multiple markets to unlock its full potential, but effective algorithms for joint-market participation under price uncertainties are insufficiently explored in the existing research. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel BESS joint bidding strategy that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to bid in the spot and contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) markets. Our approach leverages a transformer-based temporal feature extractor to effectively respond to price fluctuations in seven markets simultaneously and helps DRL learn the best BESS bidding strategy in joint-market participation. Additionally, unlike conventional “black-box” DRL model, our approach is more interpretable and provides valuable insights into the temporal bidding behavior of BESS in the dynamic electricity market. We validate our method using realistic market prices from the Australian National Electricity Market. The results show that our strategy outperforms benchmarks, including both optimization-based and other DRL-based strategies, by substantial margins. Our findings further suggest that effective temporal-aware bidding can significantly increase profits in the spot and contingency FCAS markets compared to individual market participation.},

	abstract = {Local electricity markets (LEM) envision energy sectors to satisfy the ever-increasing distributed energy resources (DERs), especially residential photovoltaics (PV), in modern communities over past years. However, local energy trading faces some obstacles in practical applications. Although massive datasets are desired to train machine/deep learning models for grid operations, forecasting, load monitoring, and decision-marking, these applications raise privacy concerns. One the one hand, some clients might not be willing to endorse sharing data to others due to privacy concerns. On the other hand, the transfer of large datasets is costly. These two obstacles would become more critical in the case of a large energy sharing platform consisting of thousands of peer-to-peer clients. This paper seeks to design a privacy-preserving LEM that consists of an LEM agent, centralized energy storage (ES), prosumers, and consumers. A future global forecasting model is jointly trained using federated learning (FL), and the clients' individual forecasts and decision-making are determined at the edge of the network without compromising privacy. Numerical results of case studies show the leakage of historical load data is detrimental for the LEM clients, with 2\% to 17\% increase in costs, if their datasets are fully obtained by the agent. The LEM agent could earn a maximum of 17\% profit increase by obtaining full access to clients' datasets.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a learning-based energy management policy that takes into consideration the trade-off between the depth-of-discharge (DoD) and the lifetime of batteries. The impact of DoD on the energy management policy is often neglected in the past due to the inability to model its effect on the marginal cost per battery usage. In this work, a novel battery cost evaluation method that takes into consideration the DoD of each battery usage is proposed, and is utilized to devise the day-ahead energy management policy using reinforcement learning and linear value-function approximations. The policy determines the amount of energy to purchase for the next day in the day ahead market. A next-state policy iteration (NSPI) scheme with linear predictions of the next-day system parameters is used to learn the energy management policy. Simulations are provided based on real load profiles, pricing data, and renewable energy arrival statistics. The consideration of the battery cost due to DoD provides a more accurate evaluation of the actual energy cost and leads to an improved energy management policy.},

	abstract = {The growing penetration of renewable energy in modern power systems requires energy storage to take on more responsibilities in multiple regulation services. Battery energy storage system (BESS) possesses fast response capability and is suitable to shave peak demand and provide frequency support. This article studies coordinated bidding strategies of BESS in frequency regulation and energy markets. Challenge arises from the fact that frequency control and energy arbitrage actions are taken in different timescales, and the capacity used in either market affects the available capacity and revenue in the other one. This article proposes a two-timescale decision framework, offering the hourly base-power bid in the energy market and capacity bid in the frequency regulation market, as well as real-time responses to the automatic generation control (AGC) signal every few seconds. In the fine timescale, we employ a threshold policy to generate AGC response accounting for battery lifespan. In the coarse timescale, we establish a stochastic dynamic programming model and optimize the bidding policy without exact forecasts of market prices. To solve the stochastic dynamic programming model online, a simulation-based policy improvement method is developed to approximate the state-action value function using a heuristic base policy. The performance improvement property brought by simulation is theoretically proven. We carry out comprehensive case studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and analyze the economic impact of electricity prices and battery E/P ratio. Empirical tests show that with an E/P ratio of 3{\textbackslash}sim5, the BESS gains a higher net revenue across the lifespan.},

However, MGs, as newcomers to the utility grid, are also facing challenges due to economic deregulation of energy systems, restructuring of generation, and market-based operation. This paper comprehensively summarizes the published research works in the areas of MGs and related energy management modelling and solution techniques. First, MGs and energy storage systems are classified into multiple branches and typical combinations as the backbone of MG energy management. Second, energy management models under exogenous and endogenous uncertainties are summarized and extended to transactive energy management. Mathematical programming, adaptive dynamic programming, and deep reinforcement learning-based solution methods are investigated accordingly, together with their implementation schemes. Finally, problems for future energy management systems with dynamics-captured critical component models, stability constraints, resilience awareness, market operation, and emerging computational techniques are discussed.},

	abstract = {Driven by the global decarbonization effort, the rapid integration of renewable energy into the conventional electricity grid presents new challenges and opportunities for the battery energy storage system (BESS) participating in the energy market. Energy arbitrage can be a significant source of revenue for the BESS due to the increasing price volatility in the spot market caused by the mismatch between renewable generation and electricity demand. In addition, the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets established to stabilize the grid can offer higher returns for the BESS due to their capability to respond within milliseconds. Therefore, it is crucial for the BESS to carefully decide how much capacity to assign to each market to maximize the total profit under uncertain market conditions. This paper formulates the bidding problem of the BESS as a Markov Decision Process, which enables the BESS to participate in both the spot market and the FCAS market to maximize profit. Then, Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, is employed to learn the optimal bidding strategy from the dynamic environment of the energy market under a continuous bidding scale. The proposed model is trained and validated using real-world historical data of the Australian National Electricity Market. The results demonstrate that our developed joint bidding strategy in both markets is significantly profitable compared to individual markets.},

The interaction between the BESS operator and prosumers is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which is further reformulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved through the proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based DRL method. The case study shows that the proposed method could further increase the revenues of the BESS operator.},

	abstract = {The utilization of large-scale distributed renewable energy (RE) has facilitated the development of multiple microgrids (MMGs). However, direct data collection from different microgrids for energy management may pose a threat to microgrid privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated multi-microgrid energy management approach that accounts for carbon trading. First, a distributed inter-microgrid trading mechanism is designed to simplify energy and carbon trading in multiple microgrids. Second, a Markov (MDP)-based distributed MMG model is developed, which adopts the idea of federated learning, so that the model does not need to directly access the data of the microgrids when solving, which protects the privacy and data security of the microgrids. Finally, the model is solved by introducing an asynchronous federation mechanism to train the DDPG, which accelerates the convergence speed and obtains higher economic returns. The effectiveness of this energy management method is verified while ensuring data privacy and security.},

A Node represents each campus, and Wi-Fi makes the connection inside each node. These nodes are connected via the Internet to the Main Control Unit (MCU) represented by Raspberry Pi connected to the cloud. Depending on the received data from the Nodes, the MCU will make the correct decision for each node using intelligent algorithms and the user's requirement. Then, control commands are initiated, and the node's appliances can be controlled automatically (or even manually) from the MCU.},

Energy management systems that are predictive and exchange-price oriented can help to leverage flexibility while lowering energy costs. In this paper, the value of flexibility is assessed in two scenarios of low and high energy prices. To that end, a self-learning home energy management system is introduced that takes into account the new volatility of high stock market electricity prices. The proposed approach is compared to a baseline system, which is a typical household self-consumption optimization. The findings indicate a significant economic potential of an exchange-price oriented usage of residential flexibility options in contrast to self-consumption optimization. Furthermore, the value of flexibility for the exemplary residential system increased more than fivefold between 2021 and 2022, while prices increased about fourfold.},

Demand response can promote enhancing demand flexibility and energy efficiency while reducing consumer costs. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based approach to utilize real-time system information to facilitate demand response programs for minimizing electricity costs and efficient load shaping. Achieving real-time autonomous demand response in networks of buildings is challenging due to uncertain system parameters, the dynamic market price, and complex coupled operational constraints. To develop a scalable approach for automated demand response in networks of interconnected buildings, coordination between buildings is necessary to ensure demand flexibility and the grid's stability. We propose a MADRL technique that utilizes an actor-critic algorithm incorporating shared attention mechanism to enable effective real-time coordinated demand response in grid-responsive buildings. The presented case studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed MADRL approach to obtain decentralized cooperative policies without knowledge of building energy systems. The viability of the proposed control approach is also demonstrated by a reduction of over 6\% net load demand compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Wind energy has been rapidly gaining popularity as a means for combating climate change. However, the variable nature of wind generation can undermine system reliability and lead to wind curtailment, causing substantial economic losses to wind power producers. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) that serve as onsite backup sources are among the solutions to mitigate wind curtailment. However, such an auxiliary role of the BESS might severely weaken its economic viability. This paper addresses the issue by proposing joint wind curtailment reduction and energy arbitrage for the BESS. We decouple the market participation of the co-located wind-battery system and develop a joint-bidding framework for the wind farm and BESS. It is challenging to optimize the joint-bidding because of the stochasticity of energy prices and wind generation. Therefore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning to maximize the overall revenue from the spot market while unlocking the BESS’s potential in concurrently reducing wind curtailment and conducting energy arbitrage. We validate the proposed strategy using realistic wind farm data and demonstrate that our joint-bidding strategy responds better to wind curtailment and generates higher revenues than the optimization-based benchmark. Our simulations also reveal that the extra wind generation used to be curtailed can be an effective power source to charge the BESS, resulting in additional financial returns.},

In particular, an off-policy reinforcement learning is introduced enabling the EMS to determine the optimal price that should be announced to the prosumers on an hourly-basis toward minimizing the overall system's cost. In this process, the utility companies' hourly-based wholesale price and the prosumers' energy generation and consumption characteristics are considered as input.

HEMS monitors the environment and the energy usage, visually represents the energy consumption, and effectively controls the appliances, thus HEMS helps to reduce the energy cost as well as to maintain users' comfort. The optimal operation schedule of the appliances for the cost saving, however, does not always coincident with the user's desired operation schedule of the appliances because the optimal operation schedule is fixed by HEMS and hence the users could not change the operation schedule even when they need. From this point of view, we address the energy management system which enables the users to use the appliances at their disposal, not only for saving the cost.

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the importance of energy management has been raised due to increasing electricity demand and consumers' unawareness of their electricity consumption. The paper proposes a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and reinforcement learning-based algorithm to schedule the home appliances as well as an optimized and efficient way of profiting from renewable energy source with the utilization of energy storage systems. The objective of the HEMS is to decrease energy cost, customer dissatisfaction, and grid overloading. Two types of appliances were considered: non-shiftable controllable, shiftable interruptible. A simulation of the case study where the forecasted values were fed to the HEMS algorithm demonstrated a total profit increase by 15\% due to the renewable energy source, making the value of total profit 63.5 units in one day. The simulation was done for a single house loading profile and throughout the capacity change of the energy storage system, a maximum profit was derived. These results show the efficient function of HEMS with the utilization of the proposed ANN, reinforcement learning, and energy decision algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the efficient bidding of a Photovoltaic power plant with Energy Storage System (PV-ESS) participating in Day-Ahead (DA) and Real-Time (RT) energy and reserve markets under uncertainty. The Energy Management System (EMS) is based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). The MADRL scheme aims to maximize the profit of the hybrid PV-ESS plant through an efficient bidding in both markets. Results show that the MADRL framework can fulfill both the financial and physical constraints faced by the PV-ESS plant while providing energy and ancillary services. Daily market incomes have comparable mean values regarding traditional optimization approaches (average value of 1839 USD), but with a 45.3\% smaller variance. Furthermore, it maintains a reference-tracking performance of 86.63\% for one-year-round participation, against a 73.05\% and 79.13\% performance obtained with scenario-based robust and stochastic programming implementations, respectively.},

	abstract = {This article discusses and simulates a demand management algorithm in a building with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and on-grid supply scheduling using deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) and rule-based controllers (Fuzzy logic). BESS is used for supplying the load profile and minimizing the electricity bills of the building. Deferrable loads of the building are controlled to reduce power consumption during peak time. Controllers used in this paper aim to optimize multi-objectives, including the cost of utility bills, state of health of battery systems (SOH), and reliability of the power source. First, this article works with optimizing BESS using the fuzzy logic controller and compares the results with DRL agent outputs. Secondly, commercial loads are modeled based on the deferrability index to be introduced into the optimization problem. Finally, the paper presents a model for controlling the battery and on-grid supply schedule, minimizing the annual electricity bill without draining the battery’s SOH and disturbing the residential comfort of household appliances.},
