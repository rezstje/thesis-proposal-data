	abstract = {Dual -motor battery electric vehicles (DM-BEVs) are a trending technology in the electric vehicle market. They have the potential to achieve higher energy savings and dynamic performances compared to singlespeed, single -motor BEVs. However, a more complex and robust energy management system (EMS) is needed to achieve these benefits. Hence, this work reviews the design process and real-time implementation of EMSs tailored for DM-BEVs, starting from the fundamental concepts of two -motor coupling. The advantages and disadvantages of the most popular dual -motor architectures and their influence on the EMS design complexity are presented, followed by a revision of the reported energy management controllers. Besides the most prominent methods, classified as rule -based or optimization -based techniques, reinforcement learningbased EMSs are discussed in detail, given their near -optimal, real-time implementation and adaptability to newer, unforeseen drive cycles. Finally, the standard procedures and equipment required to assess the EMS' performance with hardware -in -the -loop tests are presented. Conclusions and open challenges for the energy management controllers of DM-BEVs are discussed at the end of this work.},

It is important for BESS owners to maximise their profit by deciding how to balance between the different offers and bidding with the rivals. Therefore, this paper formulates the BESS bidding problem as a Markov Decision Process(MDP) to maximise the total profit from the e Automation Generation Control (AGC) market and the energy market, considering the factors such as charging/discharging losses and the lifetime of the BESS. In the proposed algorithm, function approximation technology is introduced to handle the continuous massive bidding scales and avoid the dimension curse. As a model-free approach, the proposed algorithm can learn from the stochastic and dynamic environment of a power market, so as to help the BESS owners to decide their bidding and operational schedules profitably. Several case studies illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed algorithm.},

An economic analysis is conducted using the developed interface. An energy management system establishes a dynamic market framework, enabling energy trading via P2P market operators and distribution system operators. The implemented trading platform is chosen depending on pricing variations across different time intervals for home models. The P2P energy trading system employs mathematical modeling via deep learning to achieve an optimal solution that minimizes costs. The study uses other domestic models and optimization techniques to explore the amount of energy traded across households and timeframes. Additionally, it investigates the accomplishment of two-way energy transfer in electric cars, the importance of energy storage and photovoltaic systems, and various housing scenarios concerning peer -to -peer energy trading.

	abstract = {Reducing energy costs is an emerging aspect in the research on the economic and environmental dimen-sions of manufacturing systems. The share of electricity cost accounts for approximately 60 \% of the total energy cost of a manufacturing system, whereas the share of oil, coal, and gas accounts for the remaining 40 \%. The electricity cost is dependent on the electricity price and usage. In terms of the electricity price, one of the pricing strategies widely used in the USA and Europe is called real-time pricing (RTP), which is characterised by hourly price changes. Compared to other pricing strategies, RTP yields the highest reward and the highest risk. In the RTP strategy, the electricity price is influenced by the supply and demand of the energy market. Hence, the energy cost of manufacturing cannot be determined by the manufacturing companies, implying a high level of risk. However, if manufacturing companies seize the opportunity to perform more manufacturing tasks when the energy price is low, the cost-savings will be significant, im-plying a high level of reward. In this study, we propose an integrated energy management system (IEMS) to reduce the energy cost of manufacturing systems. The IEMS consists of an energy storage equipment and an intelligent switch mechanism. When the electricity price is high, the manufacturing system is powered by the energy storage equipment. When the electricity price is low, the manufacturing system is powered by the public electricity grid, and the energy storage equipment is charged. The decision-making of these operations is performed by the intelligent switch mechanism based on double deep Q-learning. To validate this framework, a case study is conducted, in which an IEMS is developed to reduce the electricity cost of a scale-model factory. Based on an online test of the IEMS in different manufacturing cycles, it is concluded that the proposed IEMS approach achieves a cost reduction of approximately 57.21 \%.(c) 2022 The Authors.

The MG comprises of wind and photovoltaic resources, diesel generator, electrical energy storage, and combined heat and power generations to serve electrical and thermal loads at the lower-level of energy management system (EMS). All distributed energy resources (DERs) and customers are modelled as self-interested agents who adopt reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviours and operation costs. Based on this algorithm, agents have the capability to interact with each other in a distributed manner and find the best strategy in competitive environment. At the upper-level of EMS, there is an energy management agent that gathers the information of agents of lower-level and clears the MG electrical and thermal energy market in line with predetermined goals. Utilizing energy availability from different DERs and variety of customers' consumption patterns, considering uncertainty of renewable generation and load consumption and taking into account technical constraint of DERs are the strengths of the presented framework. Performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated under different conditions of agents learning and using epsilon-greedy, soft-max and upper confidence bound methods.

	abstract = {Wind energy has been increasingly adopted to mitigate climate change. However, the variability of wind energy causes wind curtailment, resulting in considerable economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind curtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly weaken the economic potential of BESS in energy trading. Ideal BESS scheduling should balance onsite wind curtailment reduction and market bidding, but practical implementation is challenging due to coordination complexity and the stochastic nature of energy prices and wind generation. We investigate the joint-market bidding strategy of a co-located wind-battery system in the spot and Regulation Frequency Control Ancillary Service markets. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based approach that decouples the system’s market participation into two related Markov decision processes for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind curtailment while performing joint-market bidding to maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we validated the coordinated bidding strategy, with outcomes surpassing the optimization-based benchmark in terms of higher revenue by approximately 25\% and more wind curtailment reduction by 2.3 times. Our results show that joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance of wind-battery systems compared to participating in each market separately. Simulations also show that using curtailed wind generation as a power source for charging the BESS can lead to additional financial gains. The successful implementation of our algorithm would encourage co-location of generation and storage assets to unlock wider system benefits.},

However, FCSs may result in the power system overload. Therefore, the deployment of the battery energy storage system (BESS) in FCSs is considered as a potential solution to avoid system overload. However, the optimal operation of FCSs equipped with BESS is challenging due to the involvement of several uncertainties, such as EV arrival/departure times and electricity prices. Therefore, in this study, a deep reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to operate FCSs with BESS under these uncertainties. The stateof-the-art soft actor-critic method (SAC) is adopted and the model is trained with one-year data to cover seasonality and different types of days (working days and holidays). The performance of SAC is compared with two other deep reinforcement learning methods, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient. A comprehensive reward function is devised to train the model offline, which can then be used for the real-time operation of FCS with BESS under different uncertainties. The trained model has successfully reduced the peak load of the FCS during both weekdays and holidays by optimizing the operation of the BESS. In addition, the robustness of the proposed model against different EV arrival scenarios and extreme market price scenarios is also evaluated. Simulation results have shown that the proposed model can reduce the peak load of the FCS under diverse conditions in the desired fashion.},

It is based on distributed energy sources and the electricity consumers' flexibility who are the members of the community. In search of the most effective ways to interact within themselves and with the external energy system, local energy communities become platforms for exciting experiments in the field of new energy practices including local markets for flexibility, building cooperative micro grids, achieving energy autonomy, and many others. This work aims to present a unified approach to building and optimally managing the community microgrids with an internal market, given the social, environmental, and economic benefits of a particular location of such a community. A new modeling framework is introduced, based on bilevel programming and reinforcement learning, for structuring and solving the internal local market of a community microgrids, composed of entities that may exchange energy and services among themselves. The overall framework is formulated in the form of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while the upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator (Community EMS). We strengthen the traditional bilevel problem statement by the local energy management system (Local EMS) introduction based on Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. Our approach makes it possible to enable interaction of the local control systems for microgrids with the community microgrid operator as part bilevel programming problem solution. Numerical results obtained on the real test case of the microgrid community for the settlements located in the Transbaikal National Park (Russia), which include various renewable energy sources (wind, solar power, biomass gasifiers) and storage devices, show reduction of the LCOE index from 20\% to 40\% and improving the quality of electricity supply to the analyzed settlements.

Accordingly, it is vital to apply a suitable energy management system to provide the required energy of the PEV and ensure the health of the energy storage systems in the H-MG. This paper proposes a continuous real-time cooperative multi-agent system (MAS) for H-MG. Real-time MAS interacts with H-MG agents to perform as independent learners applying a distributed and cooperative reinforcement learning method, while state variables are shared to coordinate their real-time behavior. Therefore, the fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) method is investigated to control the agents in the continuous state space and achieve an efficient solution. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy to guarantee the energy supply and reduce the electricity market price. The results of the simulation demonstrate that using the proposed cooperative MAS with the real-time FQL method in the energy management of the H-MG will reduce the electricity market price by 10\%, increase the health of the storage system by 35.67\%, and enhance the utilization of the PV system to charge PEV for 8\% at the peak load demand.},

Batteries are one of the key technologies in BEV since they strongly affect the vehicle cost and driving range, two of the major concerns of BEV costumers. While the energy storing capabilities of BEVs usually exceed commuting requirements, batteries can be also utilized for home energy management system using bi-directional charging technology. This paper introduces an efficient energy management system for a smart home with BEVs and a bidirectional charger by addressing the corresponding optimal control problem of deciding the battery charging and discharging strategy to minimize energy expenditure and cost. To this aim, the electricity price and expenditure of upcoming weeks is forecasted using data from the present week, and a model of the complete system is used to find the optimal solutions by means of backward induction in a receding horizon approach.

	abstract = {Effective bidding on multiple electricity products under uncertainty would allow a more profitable market participation for hybrid power plants with variable energy resources and storage systems, therefore aiding the decarbonization process. This study deals with the effective bidding of a photovoltaic plant with an energy storage system (PV-ESS) participating in multi-timescale electricity markets by providing energy and ancillary services (AS) products. The energy management system (EMS) aims to maximize the plant's profits by efficiently bidding in the day-ahead and real-time markets while considering the awarded products' adequate delivery. EMS's bidding decisions are usually obtained from traditional mathematical optimization frameworks. However, since the addressed problem is a multi-stage stochastic program, it is often intractable and suffers the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for efficient multi-timescale bidding. Two agents based on multi-view artificial neural networks with recurrent layers (MVANNs) are adjusted to map environment observations to actions. Such mappings use as inputs available information related to electricity market products, bidding decisions, solar generation, stored energy, and time representations to bid in both electricity markets. Sustained by a price-taker assumption, the physically and financially constrained EMS's environment is simulated by employing historical data. A shared cumulative reward function with a finite time horizon is used to adjust both MVANNs' weights simultaneously during the learning phase. We compare the proposed MADRL framework against scenario-based two-stage robust and stochastic optimization methods. Results are provided for one-year-round market participation of the hybrid plant at a 1-minute resolution. The proposed method achieved statistically significant higher profits, less variable incomes from both electricity markets, and better provision of awarded products by achieving smaller and less variable energy imbalances through time.},

To preserve the information privacy of agents, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to find the optimal operating point of microgrid distributedly. To enhance the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm, an accelerated ADMM is presented based on the concept of over-relaxation. In the proposed framework, the agents do not need to share with other parties either their historical data for forecasting purposes or commercially sensitive information for scheduling purposes.

	abstract = {Given the steep rises in renewable energy's proportion in the global energy mix expected over several decades, a systematic way to plan the long-term deployment is needed. The main challenges are how to handle the sig-nificant uncertainties in technologies and market dynamics over a large time horizon. The problem is further complicated by the fast-timescale volatility of renewable energy sources, potentially causing grid instability and unfulfilled demands. As a remedy, energy storage and power-to-hydrogen systems are considered in conjunction with energy management system but doing so raises the complexity of the planning problem further. In this work, the long-term capacity planning for a hybrid microgrid (HM) system is formulated as a multi-period stochastic decision problem that considers uncertainties occurring at multiple timescales. Long-term capacity decisions are inherently linked with energy dispatch and storage decisions occurring at fast-timescale and it is best to solve for them simultaneously. However, the computational demand for solving it becomes quickly intractable with problem size. To this end, we propose to develop a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of the problem and use simulation-based reinforcement learning for multi-period capacity investments of the planning horizon. The MDP includes the policies used for dispatch and storage operation, which are represented by linear programming as a part of the simulation model. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated with a case study, where decisions over multiple decades are considered along with various un-certainties of multi-timescales.

These decisions are made with the aim of maximizing the profit achieved by the REP under the assumption that mixed types of customers with different behaviors in the electricity market are considered. While some of the customers have installed smart meters with an embedded home energy management system (HEMS) in their home, others do not participate in the demand response (DR) programs. For this purpose, a bi-level hybrid demand modeling framework is proposed. It firstly uses an optimal energy management algorithm with bill minimization in order to model the behavior of customers with smart meters. Then, using a customers? behavior learning machine (CBLM), the behavior of other groups without smart meters is modeled. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model cannot only schedule usage of home appliances to the interests of customers with smart meters but can also be used to understand electricity usage behavior of customers without smart meters. The proposed model includes a stacked auto-encoder (SAE), one of the deep learning (DL) methods suitable for real-valued inputs, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the established hybrid demand model for all customers, a profit maximization algorithm is developed in order to achieve optimal prices for the REP under relevant market constraints. The results of the case studies confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Due to electricity market deregulation over the past two decades, the responsibility for new generation is with private investors who seek profit maximisation. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which are one solution to combat the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, also require private investment for widespread deployment. This paper develops a methodology for applying Real Options Analysis to a BESS project from the perspective of private investors to determine the optimal investment time and BESS capacity size (MWh). Two models with different timescales are utilized: the operational model which is hourly, and the planning model which is yearly. The operational model is solved using a reinforcement learning algorithm called Deterministic Policy Gradient, while the planning model is solved using a MATLAB inbuilt nonlinear global optimiser called patternsearch. The methodology is demonstrated for a 100 MW BESS connected to the Irish grid and trading exclusively in the day-ahead market. Three different BESS CAPEX future realisations are analysed along with three different BESS manufacturers' degradation warranties for C-Rates under 0.37C. The results show that BESS CAPEX has minimal influence on investment timing but has a significant effect on BESS size. Furthermore, extrapolating degradation warranty for C-Rates greater than 0.37C does not influence optimal investment timing or sizing, while a change in BESS energy retention limit at year 10 can have a significant influence on the viability of a BESS project.},

	abstract = {The future of energy flexibility in microgrids (MGs) is steering towards a highly granular control of the end-user customers. This calls for more highly accurate uncertainty forecasting and optimal management of risk and flexibility options. This paper presents a novel data-driven model to optimize the operation of MGs based on a risk-averse flexi-intelligent energy management system (RFEMS), considering the rising challenge of global climate change. It considers the presence of renewables, a diesel generator, and flexibility resources (FRs) containing a demand response program (DRP), distributed electric vehicles (EVs), and electric springs (ESs). In the first phase, the proposed model, by means of a novel hybrid deep-learning (DL) model, forecasts uncertain parameters associated with wind and solar generations, load demand, and day-ahead energy market price. The architecture of the proposed hybrid forecasting model is composed of several stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and a cascade neural network. In the second phase, the MG operator (MGO), based on the obtained uncertainty forecasting results, in the context of a hybrid risk-controlling model, optimizes the MG operation using the provided demand-side flexibility. The proposed optimization problem is linearized stochastic pro-gramming with robust concepts, subject to AC optimal power flow constraints, MG flexibility restrictions, and operating limits of local resources. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed RFEMS by using real German datasets on a 33-bus test MG is analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed forecasting model over several hybrid DL models. In particular, the root mean square error (RMSE) index for wind, solar, load, and price forecasting is improved by 53.35\%, 73.24\%, 80.24\%, and 58.1\%, respectively. Further analysis of the proposed RFEMS reveals that operating indices in two 33-bus and 69-bus test networks are significantly improved. It paves pathways to risk-averse, flexible, and economic operation of smart active dis-tribution networks.},

Taking advantages of function approximation approaches, a reinforcement learning algorithm is introduced to the designed model, which can cope with the continuous and massive states of the proposed model and avoid the dimension curse.

	abstract = {Given the significant challenges posed by the vast and diverse data in energy management, this study introduces a two-stage approach: optimal energy management system (OEMS) and dynamic real-time operation (DRTOP). These stages employ a multi-agent policy-oriented deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, aiming to minimize operating and energy exchange costs through interactions in the networked microgrid (NMG) energy market. The primary objectives include minimizing the distribution system operator (DSO) cost and optimizing the exchanged power between DSO and NMG, and the power transmission losses and the secondary include minimizing MG’s operating cost, optimal use of renewable energy resources (RER) and energy storage systems (ESS), minimizing the exchanged power cost with the main grid and, risk analysis. The OEMS\&DRTOP model is developed based on the Stackelberg game theory and the DRL structure. The DRL model is developed in two offline learning and online distributed operation phases to minimize the computational burden, time, and DRL operation process. This study’s results show the high efficiency of the presented approach to minimizing the operating cost, the exchanged power based on the price uncertainty, power transmission losses, and, RER and ESSs optimal participation. In addition, regarding computational load, the proposed concept demonstrates a 12.9\% reduction compared to the dueling deep Q-network method and a 17\% reduction compared to the deep Q-network method. Also regarding computational time, the proposed concept demonstrates a 17.13\% reduction compared to the dueling deep Q-network method and a 25.6\% reduction compared to the deep Q-network method.},

	abstract = {Integrating renewable energy resources and deploying energy management devices offer great opportunities to develop autonomous energy management systems in grid-responsive buildings. Demand response can promote enhancing demand flexibility and energy efficiency while reducing consumer costs. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based approach with an agent assigned to individual buildings to facilitate demand response programs with diverse loads, including space heating/cooling and electrical equipment. Achieving real-time autonomous demand response in networks of buildings is challenging due to uncertain system parameters, the dynamic market price, and complex coupled operational constraints. To develop a scalable approach for automated demand response in networks of interconnected buildings, coordination between buildings is necessary to ensure demand flexibility and the grid's stability. We propose a MADRL technique that utilizes an actor-critic algorithm incorporating shared attention mechanism to enable effective and scalable real-time coordinated demand response in grid-responsive buildings. The presented case studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to obtain decentralized cooperative policies for electricity costs minimization and efficient load shaping without knowledge of building energy systems. The viability of the proposed control approach is also demonstrated by a reduction of over 6\% net load demand compared to standard reinforcement learning approaches, deep deterministic policy gradient, and soft actor-critic algorithm, as well as a tailored MADRL approach for demand response.},

	abstract = {The convergence of hydrogen energy with artificial intelligence (AI) in smart infrastructure has significant potential to revolutionise the worldwide energy sector. This article thoroughly examines the progress, difficulties, and potential breakthroughs in the integration of AI technology with smart grids to enhance the use of hydrogen energy . The study focuses on utilising AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning to optimise the processes of generating, distributing, and utilising energy. The discoveries stemming from this investigation facilitate prognostic maintenance, instantaneous decision-making, and effective demand-side management, augmenting the durability and eco-friendliness of energy systems.

The operation of these storage facilities can be optimized using automated energy management systems.

The economic performance of the presented approach is compared to a rule-based energy management strategy as a lower benchmark and a Dynamic Programming-based unit commitment as an upper benchmark. The comparative analysis highlights both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the implemented Reinforcement Learning approach. The simulation results indicate a promising potential of Reinforcement Learning-based algorithms for hydrogen production planning, outperforming the lower benchmark. Furthermore, a novel approach in the scientific literature demonstrates that including energy and price forecasts in the Reinforcement Learning observation space significantly improves optimization results and allows the algorithm to take variable prices into account. An unresolved challenge, however, is balancing multiple conflicting objectives in a setting with few degrees of freedom. As a result, no parameterization of the reward function could be found that fully satisfied all predefined targets, highlighting one of the major challenges for Reinforcement Learning -based energy management algorithms to overcome.},

We examine the effect of PEV charging and discharging patterns on H-MG energy flow, considering various scenarios such as high renewable energy generation, different levels of PEV penetration, and EPG connection status. Our findings indicate that an efficient EMS can significantly enhance H-MGs’ overall efficiency by intelligently scheduling PEV charging and discharging, maximizing the use of locally generated renewable energy, and reducing peak load on the EPG. We demonstrate that a cooperative multi-agent system EMS, driven by a robust continuous and real-time fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) method, can reduce electricity market prices by 15\% by increasing the use of renewable energy generation by 25\%. To fully realize the benefits of EMS, we address challenges such as reducing dependence on EPG by 30\%, improving battery state by 12\%, and ensuring EPG stability in the face of uncertainties.},

A computational case study conducted with nine residential buildings revealed the attention-based MA-DRL agent’s ability to execute decentralized cooperative policies without knowledge of building systems models or electricity price dynamics.

Their capabilities for solving complex optimization tasks have made them extremely attractive also for the design of the Energy Management System (EMS) of electrified vehicles. Among the plethora of existing techniques, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have unprecedented potential since they can self-learn by directly interacting with the external environment through a trial-and-error procedure. In this paper, a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent, which exploits Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to map the state-action pair to its value, was trained to reduce the CO2 emissions of a state-of-the-art diesel Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) available on the European market. The proposed methodology was tested on a virtual test rig of the investigated vehicle while operating on a charge-sustaining logic. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the reward to test the capabilities of different penalty functions to improve the fuel economy while guaranteeing the battery charge sustainability. The potential of the proposed control strategy was firstly assessed on the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) and benchmarked against a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimization to evaluate each reward. Then the best agent was tested on a wide range of type-approval and Read Driving Emission (RDE) scenarios. The results show that the best-performing agent can reach performance close to the DP reference, with a limited gap (7 \%) in terms of CO2 emissions.},
