	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing technology that significantly changed the human life by automating everything around us. It enables us to manage IoT devices 24/7 from anywhere. However, it also brings several cyber security risks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. A large-scale DDoS attack immediately overwhelms the victim’s network or system with a massive volume of unwanted traffic from the pool of compromised IoT devices. As a result, it prevents legitimate users from accessing the victim’s services or applications. Further, protecting Internet-based applications and networks from large-scale IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks is a challenging task. In the literature, several techniques are available to protect networks and services from IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks. However, the occurrence and sophistication of IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks are expanding every year. In this article, we propose a comprehensive approach for identifying IoT traffic-based DDoS attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed XGB-based model achieves significant accuracy of 99.89\%.},

	abstract = {In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.},

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has become more attractive to provide electricity to rural and remote areas, which increases the reliability and sustainability of the electrical system, particularly for areas where electricity extension is difficult. Despite this, the integration of hybrid RESs is accompanied by many problems as a result of the intermittent and unstable nature of RESs. The extant literature has discussed the integration of RESs, but it is not comprehensive enough to clarify all the factors that affect the integration of RESs. In this paper, a comprehensive review is made of the integration of RESs. This review includes various combinations of integrated systems, integration schemes, integration requirements, microgrid communication challenges, as well as artificial intelligence used in the integration. In addition, the review comprehensively presents the potential challenges arising from integrating renewable resources with the grid and the control strategies used. The classifications developed in this review facilitate the integration improvement process. This paper also discusses the various optimization techniques used to reduce the total cost of integrated energy sources. In addition, it examines the use of up-to-date methods to improve the performance of the electrical grid. A case study is conducted to analyze the impact of using artificial intelligence when integrating RESs. The results of the case study prove that the use of artificial intelligence helps to improve the accuracy of operation to provide effective and accurate prediction control of the integrated system. Various optimization techniques are combined with ANN to select the best hybrid model. PSO has the fast convergence rate for reaching to the minimum errors as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) percentage reaches 1.10\% in 3367.50 s.},

	abstract = {Robust reliability Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) turns out to be a crucial step for an efficient energy management system in a modern power grid, especially under renewable energy employment. The integration of all such components in a GEP model makes it a large-scale, nonlinear, and mixed-variable mathematical modeling problem. In this paper, the presence of wind energy uncertainty is analyzed. Both long and short-term uncertainties are incorporated into the proposed GEP model. The first step concerns the impact of long-term wind uncertainties through the annual variations of the capacity credit of two real sites in Egypt at Zafaranh and Shark El-ouinate. The second step deals with the short-term uncertainties of each wind site. The wind speed uncertainty of each wind site is modeled by probability distribution function. Then, wind power is estimated from the wind power curve for each wind site and Monte-Carlo Simulation is performed. Fast Gas Turbine and/or Pump Hydro Storage are incorporated to cope with short-term uncertainties. Sensitivity analysis is implemented for 3, 6, and 12 stages as short and long planning horizons to minimize the total costs with wind energy penetration and emission reduction over planning horizons. Also, a novel Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA) with model modifications such as Virtual Mapping Procedure, Penalty Factor Approach, and the Modified of Intelligent Initial Population Generation is utilized for solving the proposed GEP problem. The obtained results are compared with other algorithms to ensure the superior performance of the proposed HBA. According to the results of the applicable test systems, the proposed HBA performs better than the others, with percentage reductions over CSA, AO, BES, and PSO ranging up to 4.2, 2.72, 2.7, and 3.4\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the challenge of accurate load forecasting in cluster microgrids, where distributed energy systems interlink to operate seamlessly. As renewable energy sources become more widespread, ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply in the face of variable weather conditions is a significant challenge for power providers. The variability in energy consumption patterns, influenced by human behavior and environmental conditions, further complicates load prediction. The inherent instability of solar and wind energies adds complexity to forecasting load demand accurately. This paper suggests a solution in addressing some challenges by proposing a Modified Temporal Convolutional Feed Forward Network (MTCFN) for load forecasting in cluster microgrids. The Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm is employed to determine optimal configurations, addressing the intricacies of this complex optimization problem. Data collected from the Microgrid Market Share and Forecast 2024–2032 report, the efficiency of the proposed approach is evaluated through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and R-squared. The RMSE, MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-squared values of the MTCFN are 0.4\%, 1.5\%, 0.6\%, 6.8\%, and 0.8\%, respectively. The optimization algorithm's effectiveness is cross-validated through rigorous testing, training, and validation processes, revealing that the FFNN model based on the Fire Hawk Optimization algorithm yields superior load forecasting results. This research contributes to the advancement of signal, image, and video processing in the context of resilient and accurate energy management in cluster microgrids.},

But the integration of renewable energy resources for hybrid power generation poses two technical challenges: (a) uncertainty and (b) variability due to renewable energy (RE) characteristics that make forecasting of generated power availability arduous. New technological advances to improve design and operation is the need of the hour. Demand response (DR) can be the answer as it provides flexibility to operate automatically as well as manual interference. DR programs support active consumer participation. Yet, carrying real-time decisions out of large-scale data is a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based demand response has recently emerged as enabling technologies to address this issue. This paper carries an extensive summary developed out of review carried out from research articles published in this domain from the year 2019 up to the year 2020. The focus is on recent advances in four methods of AI: machine learning, nature-inspired algorithm, artificial neural network, and multi-agent system used in the demand response program to integrate renewable energy.},

	abstract = {Climate change has become a major problem for humanity in the last two decades. One of the reasons that caused it, is our daily energy waste. People consume electricity in order to use home/work appliances and devices and also reach certain levels of comfort while working or being at home. However, even though the environmental impact of this behavior is not immediately observed, it leads to increased CO2 emissions coming from energy generation from power plants. It has been shown that about 40\% of these emissions come from the electricity consumption and also that about 20\% of this percentage could have been saved if we started using energy more efficiently. Confronting such a problem efficiently will affect both the environment and our society. Monitoring energy consumption in real-time, changing energy wastage behavior of occupants and using automations with incorporated energy savings scenarios, are ways to decrease global energy footprint. In this review, we study intelligent systems for energy management in residential, commercial and educational buildings, classifying them in two major categories depending on whether they provide direct or indirect control. The article also discusses what the strengths and weaknesses are, which optimization techniques do they use and finally, provide insights about how these systems can be improved in the future.},

	abstract = {Short-term residential load forecasting is of great significance to smart grid applications. Deep learning techniques, especially recurrent neural networks, can greatly improve the performance of prediction models. However, deep neural networks usually have low interpretability, which creates obstacles for customers to deeply understand the prediction results and make quick responses. In addition, the existing deep learning prediction methods rely heavily on the centralized training of massive data. However, the transmission of data from the client to the server poses a threat to the data security of customers. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework with federated learning for short-term residential load forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new automatic relevance determination network for feature interpretation, combined with the encoder–decoder architecture to achieve interpretable multi-step load prediction. In the edge computing network, the training scheme based on federated learning does not share the original data, which can effectively protect data privacy. The introduction of iterative federated clustering algorithm can alleviate the problem of non-independent and identical distribution of data in different households. We use two real-world datasets to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss in detail the feature interpretation of these two datasets.},

	abstract = {The implementation of renewable energy sources reduces dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, but it comes at a significant cost to the grid due to the need for coupling multiple energy sources. This necessitates the optimization of energy production using artificial intelligence techniques that can reflect the characteristics of distributed energy management from the storage capacity of the microgrid while considering the consumer load. As such, this study develops an energy management algorithm based on the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) utility function to model the operator’s risk-aversion or risk-seeking behavior, generating optimal exchange strategies in a dynamic environment. The reinforcement learning-based agent provides an understanding of energy storage capacity constraints in aggregate load/discharge energy decision making in the microgrid, using a discrete action space that depends on a reward related to the value of the optimal online objective function of the microgrid. By analyzing microgrid management under different system state definitions, the results show that substantially improved performance can be achieved compared to a traditional model that assumes deterministic information. The findings provide solid experimental validation of the potential of deep reward-based learning techniques to enable more efficient, flexible, and cost-effective energy management, particularly with the integration of more intermittent renewable energy sources.},

If predictive information about the stochastic elements is available offline, recent works have shown that it is possible to rely on an (expensive) parameter tuning phase to improve the behavior of a simple online solver so that it roughly matches the solution quality of an anticipative approach but maintains its original efficiency. Here, we start from a state-of-the-art offline/online optimization method that relies on optimality conditions to inject knowledge of a (convex) online approach into an offline solver used for parameter tuning. We then propose to replace the offline step with (Deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, which results in a simpler integration scheme with a higher potential for generalization. We introduce two hybrid methods that combine both learning and optimization: the first optimizes all the parameters at once, whereas the second exploits the sequential nature of the online problem via the Markov Decision Process framework. In a case study in energy management, we show the effectiveness of our hybrid approaches, w.r.t. the state-of-the-art and pure RL methods. The combination proves capable of faster convergence and naturally handles constraint satisfaction.},

In the first step, we exploit the advantages of the Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep learning model to predict the next daily electricity price based on time series. In the second step, we use a type-2 fuzzy logic controller to decide which energy source will exploit the excess energy produced or meet the MG need. Real data is used in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMS whose superiority is proved through the test period. The BiLSTM forecasting model better performs compared to other related algorithms designed to the electricity price prediction. In addition, the proposed decision-making process can reduce the total MG cost and protect the batteries against the deep discharge and maximum charge in order to prolong their lifespan.

	abstract = {Today, the world experiences a surge in adoption of renewable electricity generation methods. As a consequence to this, the dependence of electricity supply and demand has parallelly seen a dramatic increase on covariates like solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature. Addressing the demand response scenario with efficient forecasting strategies is critical for the smart grid stability. With increment of renewable energy factor in total share of electricity generation, it becomes imperative to consider the external factors covariates while predicting the electricity price and load forecasting. Forecasting strategies, based on statistical and machine learning models, facilitates efficient and informed responses for electricity market. However, due to presence of large pool of forecasting models each having its own suitability, it becomes cumbersome to choose an appropriate sophisticated model selection from them. This work presents a methodological review of existing forecasting statistical and machine learning models and algorithms, with the prime purpose of choosing a best suited model for a specific environment or scenario. Data used for this purpose are a time series data, and information is very scattered in nature; thus, the process to make a full dataset and combining it with external covariates is a complex phenomenon. The work also discusses the process of making the multivariate time series dataset based on U.S. Energy Information Administration and combined it with typical meteorological year (TMY3) datasets. To validate the outcome of literature survey, detail experiment has been performed using the prepared dataset, and comparative analysis is presented.},

The framework is tested on a novel multi-energy residential microgrid model that encompasses electrical, heating and cooling storage as well as thermal production systems and renewable energy generation. One of the main challenges faced when dealing with real-time optimal control of such multi-energy systems is the need to take multiple continuous actions simultaneously. The proposed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent has shown to handle well the continuous state and action spaces and learned to simultaneously take multiple actions on the production and storage systems that allow to jointly optimize the electrical, heating and cooling usages within the smart grid. This allows the approach to be applied for the real-time optimal energy management of larger scale multi-energy Smart Grids like eco-distrits and smart cities where multiple continuous actions need to be taken simultaneously.},

Based on the living habits of the residents, the dependency modes for HERs are proposed and are integrated into the reinforcement learning algorithms.

Utilising a vehicle’s battery, however is not without a price—in this case: the driver’s mobility. Given this dependency, it is interesting that most available works consider the application of electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation, that is, detached from mobility-related issues.

	abstract = {With the popularity and affordability of ZigBee wireless sensor technology, IoT-based smart controlling system for home appliances becomes prevalent for smart home applications. From the data analytics point of view, one important objective from analyzing such IoT data is to gain insights from the energy consumption patterns, thereby trying to fine-tune the energy efficiency of the appliance usage. The data analytics usually functions at the back-end crunching over a large archive of big data accumulated over time for learning the overall pattern from the sensor data feeds. The other objective of the analytics, which may often be more crucial, is to predict and identify whether an abnormal consumption event is about to happen. For example, a sudden draw of energy that leads to hot spot in the power grid in a city, or black-out at home. This dynamic prediction is usually done at the operational level, with moving data stream, by data stream mining methods . In this paper, an improved version of very fast decision tree (VFDT) is proposed, which learns from misclassified results for the sake of filtering the noisy data from learning and maintaining sharp classification accuracy of the induced prediction model. Specifically, a new technique called misclassified recall (MR), which is a pre-processing step for self-rectifying misclassified instances, is formulated. In energy data prediction, most misclassified instances are due to data transmission errors or faulty devices. The former case happens intermittently, and the errors from the latter cause may persist for a long time. By caching up the data at the MR pre-processor, the one-pass online model learning can be effectively shielded in case of intermitting problems at the wireless sensor network; likewise the stored data could be investigated afterwards should the problem persist for long. Simulation experiments over a dataset about predicting exceptional appliances energy use in a low energy building are conducted. The reported results validate the efficacy of the new methodology VFDT + MR, in comparison to a collection of popular data stream mining algorithms from the literature.},

Pricing is accordingly used to reflect energy availability, to allocate such a limited resource to those loads that value it most. However, the strictly competitive mechanism can result in service interruption in presence of competing demand. To solve this issue we investigate on the use of forward contracts, i.e., service-level agreements priced to reflect the expectation of future supply and demand curves. Given the limited resources of microgrids, service availability is an opposite objective to the one of system reactivity.

In this regard, energy efficiency hands out challenging aspects, for both home and business usages. Scalability in energy management systems is particularly difficult in those industry sector where power consumption of branches located in remote areas need to be monitored. Being autonomous requires that behavioural rules are automatically extracted from consumption data and applied to the system. Best practices for the specific energy configuration should be devised to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Best practices should also be revised and applied without human intervention against topology changes. In this paper, the Internet of Things paradigm and machine learning techniques are exploited to (1) define a novel system architecture for centralised energy efficiency in distributed sub-networks of electric appliances, (2) extract behavioural rules, identify best practices and detect device types. A system architecture tailored for autonomous energy efficiency has interesting applications in smart industry—where energy managers may effortlessly monitor and optimally setup a large number of sparse divisions—and smart home—where impaired people may avoid energy waste through an autonomous system that can be employed by the users as a delegate for decision making.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of new technologies such as smart grid and increasing the use of renewable energy in the grid, energy prediction has become more important in the electricity industry. Furthermore, with growing the integration of power generated from renewable energy sources into grids, an accurate forecasting tool for the reduction in undesirable effects of this scenario is essential. This study has developed a novel approach based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) for forecasting day-ahead solar power. The aim is to find a pattern of solar power changes at a given time in consecutive days. The proposed approach consists of two steps. In the first step, the cosine similarity is used to determine the similarity of solar power variations on consecutive days to a particular vector. In the second step, the obtained information from the first step is fed to HMM as a feature vector. These data are used for training and forecasting day-ahead solar power. After obtaining the preliminary results of the prediction, two known filters are utilized as post-processing to remove spikes and smooth the results. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested on real NREL data. No meteorological data (even solar radiation) are used; moreover, the model is fed only from the solar power of the past 23 days. To evaluate the proposed method, a feed-forward neural network and a simple HMM are examined with the same data and conditions. All three methods are tested with and without the post-processing. The results show that the proposed model is superior to other examined methods in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

This work is focused on hourly scheduling of the appliances being used in a smart home targeting the daily electricity cost minimization. A new heuristic scheme is introduced for hourly appliances scheduling on user side in this paper. The proposed scheme works at the electricity management controller level, installed in a smart home, within a SG infrastructure.

Such changes may affect models’ effectiveness over time, requiring permanent updates of parameters and structure to maintain performance. Several supervised machine learning methods have been developed to be adapted to learn in dynamic and non-stationary environments. One of the most well-known and efficient learning methods is neural networks. This paper focuses on the different neural networks developed to build learning models able to adapt to concept drifts on streaming data. Their performance will be studied and compared using meaningful criteria. Their limits to address the challenges related to the problem of the improvement of electrical grid flexibility in presence of distributed Wind–PV renewable energy resources within the context of energy transition will be highlighted. Finally, the study provides a self-adaptive scheme based on the use of neural networks to overcome these limitations and tackle these challenges.},

However, a cost-effective and multi-objective application of these services necessitates a utilization of forecasting methods for a development of efficient capacity allocation and risk management strategies over the uncertainty of battery state-of-charge. The aim of this paper is to assess the tuning efficiency of multi-attention recurrent neural network for multi-step forecasting of battery state-of-charge under provision of primary frequency control. In particular, this paper describes hyper-parameter optimization of the network with a tree-structured parzen estimator and compares such optimization performance with random and manual search on a simulated battery state-of-charge dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the tree-structured parzen estimator enables 0.6\% and 1.5\% score improvement for the dataset compared with the random and manual search, respectively.},

	abstract = {Smart grids are considered a promising alternative to the existing power grid, combining intelligent energy management with green power generation. Decomposed further into microgrids, these small-scaled power systems increase control and management efficiency. With scattered renewable energy resources and loads, multi-agent systems are a viable tool for controlling and improving the operation of microgrids. They are autonomous systems, where agents interact together to optimize decisions and reach system objectives. This paper presents an overview of multi-agent systems for microgrid control and management. It discusses design elements and performance issues, whereby various performance indicators and optimization algorithms are summarized and compared in terms of convergence time and performance in achieving system objectives. It is found that Particle Swarm Optimization has a good convergence time, so it is combined with other algorithms to address optimization issues in microgrids. Further, information diffusion and consensus algorithms are explored, and according to the literature, many variants of average-consensus algorithm are used to asynchronously reach an equilibrium. Finally, multi-agent system for multi-microgrid service restoration is discussed. Throughout the paper, challenges and research gaps are highlighted in each section as an opportunity for future work.},

However, problems such as low efficiency of energy trading, dispatching and opaque transaction information in virtual power plants have become increasingly prominent, which greatly restricts the application and development of virtual power plants. This article first analyzes the feasibility of blockchain technology in virtual power plant energy transactions; then in the designed virtual power plant energy transaction scenario, a homomorphism that takes into account the time overhead of encryption and decryption is adopted. The encrypted data collection scheme realizes the safe transmission of distributed energy production and consumption to the virtual power plant. Finally, a weight-based blockchain consensus optimization algorithm is proposed to realize fast and highly efficient energy trading in the virtual power plant. Experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Under the premise of ensuring the security of the virtual power plant’s data source, the energy transaction throughput in the virtual power plant is greatly increased and the transaction time overhead is reduced.},
