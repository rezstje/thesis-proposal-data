	abstract = {Driven by the tremendous increase in rooftop solar panels and battery installations in Australian states, several studies have been conducted to efficiently manage battery operations with the imported grid power through battery energy storage systems (BESS). Therefore, it is crucial for the BESS to carefully decide the power set-points of the installed batteries to maintain user comfort while operating household appliances. Additionally, BESS should be capable of reducing the electricity bills by optimally managing the battery operation to sustain times of higher tariff prices for the imported grid power. This paper formulates the scheduled operation of the BESS as a Markov decision Process (MDP) that enables the BESS to Figure out numerous scenarios and decides the optimal power set-points for both batteries and grid power. A model-free reinforcement learning approach is proposed to manage the batteries’ power-sharing and grid operation set-points to solve this MDP problem. This approach utilizes the advantages of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to decide the shared power set-points every 5 minutes interval for the day ahead operation of the BESS. Finally, the proposed model is trained and validated using historical data of the Australian National Electricity market to offer an optimal scheduled control pattern for the daily BESS operations.},

However, the challenge lies in rising electricity prices during morning and evening peak-consumption times. This project assessed the feasibility and profitability of using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller in a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to make cost-effective decisions by purchasing power when it's inexpensive and selling when it's costly. MATLAB/Simulink is used to create a BESS simulation model integrated into the electricity market, with the RL agent trained using normalized observation data and a reward function.

	abstract = {The implementation of renewable energy sources reduces dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, but it comes at a significant cost to the grid due to the need for coupling multiple energy sources. This necessitates the optimization of energy production using artificial intelligence techniques that can reflect the characteristics of distributed energy management from the storage capacity of the microgrid while considering the consumer load. As such, this study develops an energy management algorithm based on the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) utility function to model the operator’s risk-aversion or risk-seeking behavior, generating optimal exchange strategies in a dynamic environment. The reinforcement learning-based agent provides an understanding of energy storage capacity constraints in aggregate load/discharge energy decision making in the microgrid, using a discrete action space that depends on a reward related to the value of the optimal online objective function of the microgrid. By analyzing microgrid management under different system state definitions, the results show that substantially improved performance can be achieved compared to a traditional model that assumes deterministic information. The findings provide solid experimental validation of the potential of deep reward-based learning techniques to enable more efficient, flexible, and cost-effective energy management, particularly with the integration of more intermittent renewable energy sources.},

Based on the living habits of the residents, the dependency modes for HERs are proposed and are integrated into the reinforcement learning algorithms. Through the case studies, it is verified that the proposed method can schedule HERs properly to satisfy the established dependency modes.

	abstract = {Reducing energy costs is an emerging aspect in the research on the economic and environmental dimen-sions of manufacturing systems. The share of electricity cost accounts for approximately 60 \% of the total energy cost of a manufacturing system, whereas the share of oil, coal, and gas accounts for the remaining 40 \%. The electricity cost is dependent on the electricity price and usage. In terms of the electricity price, one of the pricing strategies widely used in the USA and Europe is called real-time pricing (RTP), which is characterised by hourly price changes. Compared to other pricing strategies, RTP yields the highest reward and the highest risk. In the RTP strategy, the electricity price is influenced by the supply and demand of the energy market. Hence, the energy cost of manufacturing cannot be determined by the manufacturing companies, implying a high level of risk. However, if manufacturing companies seize the opportunity to perform more manufacturing tasks when the energy price is low, the cost-savings will be significant, im-plying a high level of reward. In this study, we propose an integrated energy management system (IEMS) to reduce the energy cost of manufacturing systems. The IEMS consists of an energy storage equipment and an intelligent switch mechanism. When the electricity price is high, the manufacturing system is powered by the energy storage equipment. When the electricity price is low, the manufacturing system is powered by the public electricity grid, and the energy storage equipment is charged. The decision-making of these operations is performed by the intelligent switch mechanism based on double deep Q-learning. To validate this framework, a case study is conducted, in which an IEMS is developed to reduce the electricity cost of a scale-model factory. Based on an online test of the IEMS in different manufacturing cycles, it is concluded that the proposed IEMS approach achieves a cost reduction of approximately 57.21 \%.(c) 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Fast charging stations (FCSs) can reduce the charging time of electric vehicles (EVs) and thus can help in the widespread adoption of EVs. However, FCSs may result in the power system overload. Therefore, the deployment of the battery energy storage system (BESS) in FCSs is considered as a potential solution to avoid system overload. However, the optimal operation of FCSs equipped with BESS is challenging due to the involvement of several uncertainties, such as EV arrival/departure times and electricity prices. Therefore, in this study, a deep reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to operate FCSs with BESS under these uncertainties. The stateof-the-art soft actor-critic method (SAC) is adopted and the model is trained with one-year data to cover seasonality and different types of days (working days and holidays). The performance of SAC is compared with two other deep reinforcement learning methods, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient. A comprehensive reward function is devised to train the model offline, which can then be used for the real-time operation of FCS with BESS under different uncertainties. The trained model has successfully reduced the peak load of the FCS during both weekdays and holidays by optimizing the operation of the BESS. In addition, the robustness of the proposed model against different EV arrival scenarios and extreme market price scenarios is also evaluated. Simulation results have shown that the proposed model can reduce the peak load of the FCS under diverse conditions in the desired fashion.},

	abstract = {Effective bidding on multiple electricity products under uncertainty would allow a more profitable market participation for hybrid power plants with variable energy resources and storage systems, therefore aiding the decarbonization process. This study deals with the effective bidding of a photovoltaic plant with an energy storage system (PV-ESS) participating in multi-timescale electricity markets by providing energy and ancillary services (AS) products. The energy management system (EMS) aims to maximize the plant's profits by efficiently bidding in the day-ahead and real-time markets while considering the awarded products' adequate delivery. EMS's bidding decisions are usually obtained from traditional mathematical optimization frameworks. However, since the addressed problem is a multi-stage stochastic program, it is often intractable and suffers the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for efficient multi-timescale bidding. Two agents based on multi-view artificial neural networks with recurrent layers (MVANNs) are adjusted to map environment observations to actions. Such mappings use as inputs available information related to electricity market products, bidding decisions, solar generation, stored energy, and time representations to bid in both electricity markets. Sustained by a price-taker assumption, the physically and financially constrained EMS's environment is simulated by employing historical data. A shared cumulative reward function with a finite time horizon is used to adjust both MVANNs' weights simultaneously during the learning phase. We compare the proposed MADRL framework against scenario-based two-stage robust and stochastic optimization methods. Results are provided for one-year-round market participation of the hybrid plant at a 1-minute resolution. The proposed method achieved statistically significant higher profits, less variable incomes from both electricity markets, and better provision of awarded products by achieving smaller and less variable energy imbalances through time.},

	abstract = {Integrating renewable energy resources and deploying energy management devices offer great opportunities to develop autonomous energy management systems in grid-responsive buildings. Demand response can promote enhancing demand flexibility and energy efficiency while reducing consumer costs. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based approach with an agent assigned to individual buildings to facilitate demand response programs with diverse loads, including space heating/cooling and electrical equipment. Achieving real-time autonomous demand response in networks of buildings is challenging due to uncertain system parameters, the dynamic market price, and complex coupled operational constraints. To develop a scalable approach for automated demand response in networks of interconnected buildings, coordination between buildings is necessary to ensure demand flexibility and the grid's stability. We propose a MADRL technique that utilizes an actor-critic algorithm incorporating shared attention mechanism to enable effective and scalable real-time coordinated demand response in grid-responsive buildings. The presented case studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to obtain decentralized cooperative policies for electricity costs minimization and efficient load shaping without knowledge of building energy systems. The viability of the proposed control approach is also demonstrated by a reduction of over 6\% net load demand compared to standard reinforcement learning approaches, deep deterministic policy gradient, and soft actor-critic algorithm, as well as a tailored MADRL approach for demand response.},

The EA and FR actions are taken at different timescales. The multitimescale problem is formulated as two nested Markov decision process (MDP) submodels. The problem is a complex decision-making problem with enormous high-dimensional data and uncertainty (e.g., the price of the electricity). Therefore, a novel co-optimization scheme is proposed to handle the multitimescale problem, and also coordinate EA and FR services. A triplet deep deterministic policy gradient with exploration noise decay (TDD-ND) approach is used to obtain the optimal policy at each timescale.

	abstract = {The prevalence of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart meters devices in smart grids is providing key support for measuring and analyzing the power consumption patterns. This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures.},

	abstract = {Driven by the global decarbonization effort, the rapid integration of renewable energy into the conventional electricity grid presents new challenges and opportunities for the battery energy storage system (BESS) participating in the energy market. Energy arbitrage can be a significant source of revenue for the BESS due to the increasing price volatility in the spot market caused by the mismatch between renewable generation and electricity demand. In addition, the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets established to stabilize the grid can offer higher returns for the BESS due to their capability to respond within milliseconds. Therefore, it is crucial for the BESS to carefully decide how much capacity to assign to each market to maximize the total profit under uncertain market conditions. This paper formulates the bidding problem of the BESS as a Markov Decision Process, which enables the BESS to participate in both the spot market and the FCAS market to maximize profit. Then, Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, is employed to learn the optimal bidding strategy from the dynamic environment of the energy market under a continuous bidding scale.
